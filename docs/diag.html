<p>The regression model is based on a number of assumptions. Those assumptions are made so that we can apply commonly used probability distributions to we quantify the variability associated with our estimated regression model. This means that if the assumptions are not met for our regression model, then how we quantify the variability associated with our model is no longer reliable. All our analysis with statistical inference becomes questionable.</p>
<p>In this module, you will learn how to assess whether the regression assumptions are met. We will explore ways in which we can transform our variables after diagnosing which assumptions are not met so that we can still proceed to build our regression model.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Assumptions in Linear Regression<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assumptions-in-linear-regression"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In module <a href="slr.html#slr">3</a>, we stated the SLR model as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:5SLRmod">\[\begin{equation}
y=\beta_0+\beta_{1} x + \epsilon.
\tag{5.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x\)</span>. We need to make some assumptions for the error term <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. Mathematically, the assumptions are expressed as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:5assumptions">\[\begin{equation}
\epsilon_1,\ldots,\epsilon_n \ i.i.d. \sim N(0,\sigma^2)
\tag{5.2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Breaking down <a href="diag.html#eq:5assumptions">(5.2)</a> the assumptions can be expressed as the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The errors have <strong>mean 0</strong>.</li>
<li>The errors have <strong>constant variance denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span></strong>.</li>
<li>The errors are <strong>independent</strong>.</li>
<li>The errors are <strong>normally distributed</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Letâ€™s dig a little deeper into the meaning and implications of these 4 assumptions.</p>
<div id="assumption-1-errors-have-mean-0." class="section level3" number="5.2.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Assumption 1: Errors have mean 0.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assumption-1-errors-have-mean-0."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>For each value of the predictor, the errors have <strong>mean 0</strong>. A by-product of this statement is that the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, as expressed via <span class="math inline">\(y \approx f(x)\)</span>, is correct. So, if <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x\)</span>, then the relationship is approximately linear.</p>
<p>The plots in Figure <!-- overall --> are based on simulated data. The scatterplot shown in Figure <!-- linear --> is an example of when this assumption is met. As we move from left to right on the plot, the data points are generally evenly scattered on both sides of the regression line that is overlaid.</p>

</h3>
<p>For each value of the predictor, the error terms have <strong>constant variance</strong>, denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. This implies that when looking at a scatterplot, the vertical variation of data points around the regression equation has the same magnitude everywhere.</p>
<p>The plots in Figure <!-- overall2 --> are based on simulated data. The scatterplot shown in Figure <!-- linear2 --> is an example of when this assumption is met (this figure is actually the same as Figure <!-- linear -->, so the data that produced these plots satisfy both assumptions). As we move from left to right on the plot, the vertical variation of the data points about the regression line is approximately constant.</p>
<!-- Add figure here. linear_plot.jpeg & increasing_var.jpg -->
<p>The scatterplot shown in Figure <!-- increasing --> is an example of when this assumption is <strong>not</strong> met. As we move from left to right on the plot in Figure <!-- increasing -->, the vertical variation of the data points about the regression line becomes larger as the value of the response variable gets larger, so the variance is not constant.</p>

</h4>
<p><strong>Statistical inference will no longer be reliable.</strong> This means that the results from any hypothesis test, confidence interval, or prediction interval are no longer reliable.</p>
<p>Interestingly, for the scatterplot in Figure <!-- increasing -->, we can say that assumption 1 is met, since the the data points are generally evenly scattered on both sides of the regression line. Predictions will still be unbiased; the predicted response, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span>, do not systematically over- or under-predict the response variable.

<p>The regression model is fairly robust to the assumption that the errors are normally distributed. In other words, violation of this particular assumption is not very consequential. <strong>Of the 4 assumptions, this is the least crucial to satisfy.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Scatterplot of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (assumptions 1 and 2).</li>

<span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Scatterplot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scatterplot"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>We can examine the scatterplot of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to check for assumptions 1 and 2. We want to see the following in the scatterplot:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>No nonlinear pattern</strong> (assumption 1).</li>
<li>Data points <strong>evenly scattered</strong> (for each value on the x-axis) around fitted line (assumption 1).</li>
<li>Vertical variation of data points constant (assumption 2).</li>
</ul>
<p>We have used Figure <!-- linear2 --> as an example of a scatterplot that meets these assumptions. Let us take a look at another example that we have worked with. This scatterplot is from the <code>elmhurst</code> dataset from the <code>openintro</code> package that we have been seeing in tutorials. We are regressing the amount of gift aid a student receives based on the studentâ€™s family income. The corresponding scatterplot is shown in in Figure <a href="diag.html#fig:elmhurst">5.1</a>.</p>

<p>In Figure <a href="diag.html#fig:elmhurst">5.1</a>, we see that the data points are evenly scattered around the fitted line. We also see the vertical variation of the data points is fairly constant. So assumptions that the errors have 0 mean and constant variance appear to be met.</p>

<p>While using the scatterplot is an intuitive way of assessing regression assumptions, it has a limitation. It cannot be used if we have multiple predictors in our regression, which we will encounter (and happens more often than just having one predictor). Another visualization that we can use to assess assumptions 1 and 2 is a <strong>residual plot</strong>. This is a scatterplot of residuals, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, against fitted values, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span>. We want to observe the following in a residual plot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Residuals should be <strong>evenly scattered</strong> across the horizontal axis (assumption 1).</li>
<li>The residuals should have <strong>similar vertical variation</strong> across the plot (assumption 2).</li>
<li>Some writers combine these two points into the following statement: the residuals should fall in a <strong>horizontal band around 0</strong> with no apparent pattern (assumption 1, 2).</li>
</ul>
<p>The residual plots in Figure <!-- resplots --> are based on simulated data from Figures <!-- linear -->, <!-- quadratic -->, and <!-- increasing -->.</p>
<!-- Add figure here. resplot1.jpeg, resplot2.jpeg, resplot3.jpeg -->
<p>We make the following observations:
- From Figure <!-- res1 -->, we see that the residuals are evenly scattered across the horizontal axis, and their vertical variation is fairly constant across the plot. So both assumptions are met.
- From Figure <!-- res2 -->, we see that the residuals are <strong>not</strong> evenly scattered across the horizontal axis, although their vertical variation is fairly constant across the plot. So only assumption 1 is not met.
- From Figure <!-- res3 -->, we see that the residuals are evenly scattered across the horizontal axis, but their vertical variation is <strong>not constant</strong> across the plot. In fact, the vertical variation is increasing as we move from left to right. So only assumption 2 is not met.</p>
<p>If you compare the conclusions from the residuals plots and scatterplots, they are the same. In SLR, the takeaways should be consistent.</p>

<p>Assumption 3 states that the errors are <strong>independent</strong>. This assumption implies that the values of the response variable are independent from each other. This assumption is typically assessed via knowing the nature of the data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the observations were obtained from a random sample, it is likely that the observations will be independent from each other. This is the very nature of a random sample and why random samples are preferred over convenience samples.</p></li>
<li><p>If the data has some inherent sequence, it is likely the observations will not be independent, and are dependent. For example, if I record the value of a stock at the end of each day, the value at day 2 is likely to be related to its value at day 1. So the values of stock prices at the end of each day are not independent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An autocorrelation function (ACF) plot of the residuals may be a used to help assess if the assumption that the errors are independent is met. However, the plot is not a substitute for using your understanding about the nature of the data and should only be used as a confirmation.</p>
<p>The ACF plot measures the correlation between a vector of observations and the lagged versions of the observations. If the observations are uncorrelated, the correlations between the vector of observations and lagged versions of these observations are theoretically 0. We may create an ACF plot for the residuals from our regression.</p>
<p>The ACF plot in Figure <!-- acf --> and is based on simulated data that were independently generated.</p>
<!-- Add figure here. acf.jpeg, acf_ordered.jpeg -->
<p>A few notes about the ACF plot:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ACF at lag 0 is always 1. The correlation of any vector with itself is always 1.</li>
<li>The dashed horizontal lines represent critical values. An ACF at any lag beyond the critical value indicates an ACF that is significant. We have evidence of correlation (and hence dependence) in our residuals.</li>
<li>If the observed values for the response variable are independent, then we would expect the ACFs at lags greater than 0 to be insignificant. Do note that because we are conducting multiple hypothesis tests, do not be too alarmed if the ACFs are slightly beyond the critical values at an isolated lag or 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on Figure <!-- acf -->, we see that the ACFs at all lags greater than 0 are insignificant. We do not have evidence the residuals are correlated with each other, so we do not have evidence that assumption 3 is not met.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the dataframe can be sorted in some manner (e.g.Â increasing order for response variable), and if so, we would actually expect to see significant correlations in the ACF plot. The ACF plot in Figure <!-- acf2 --> is such an example. The residuals are from the same simulated dataset, only with the data sorted by the response variable. If we had just looked at the ACF plot in Figure <!-- acf2 --> without understanding the data were simulated independently and then sorted, we would have erroneously concluded that the residuals are not independent and the regression assumption is not met.</p>

<p>A normal probability plot (also called a QQ plot) is used to assess if the distribution of a variable is normal. It typically plots the residuals against their theoretical residual if they followed a normal distribution. A QQ line is typically overlaid. If the plots fall closely to the QQ line, we have evidence that the observations follow a normal distribution.

</h3>
<p>We now know how to assess if specific regression assumptions are not met. The remedial measures involve transforming either the predictor variable and / or the response variable. These transformations are chosen to handle violations to assumptions 1 and / or 2 respectively. The general strategy on selecting which variable to transform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transforming the response variable, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, affects both assumptions 1 and 2.
<ul>
<li>Visually, we can think of transforming <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in terms of stretching or squeezing the scatterplot of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> vertically. Thus, transforming <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> affects the shape of the relationship and the vertical spread of the data points.</li>
<li>However, the <strong>choice on how we transform <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is based on handling assumption 2.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transforming the predictor variable, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> affects assumption 1 and does not theoretically affect assumption 2.
<ul>
<li>Visually, we can think of transforming <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in terms of stretching or squeezing the scatterplot of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> horizontally. Thus, transforming <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> affects the shape of the relationship but not the vertical spread of the data points.</li>
<li>Therefore, <strong>transforming <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is based on handling assumption 1.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If assumption 2 is not met, we transform <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to stabilize the variance and make it constant.</li>
<li>If assumption 1 is not met, we transform <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to find the appropriate shape to relate the variables.</li>
<li>If both assumptions are not met, we transform <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> first to stabilize the variance. Once assumption 2 is solved, check if assumption 1 is not met. If not met, transform <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assumption 1 deals with whether the way we have expressed how <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> are related, through <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, is appropriate. Assumption 2 deals with the vertical variation of the data points in the scatterplot.</p>

</h2>
<p>We transform the response variable to stabilize the variance (assumption 2). There are a couple of ways to decide the appropriate transformation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pattern seen in residual plot can guide choice in how to transform the response variable.</li>
<li>Box-Cox plot.</li>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.4.1</span> Use Pattern in Residual Plot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#use-pattern-in-residual-plot"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>We can stabilize the variance of the errors based on the residual plot, if we see either of the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>vertical variation of residuals <strong>increasing</strong> as fitted response increases, or as we move from left to right, as in Figure <!-- inc -->, or</li>
<li>vertical variation of residuals <strong>decreasing</strong> as fitted response increases, or as we move from left to right, as in Figure <!-- dec -->.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Add figure here. resplot3.jpeg, resplot4.jpeg --><p>Note that increasing variance as fitted response increases is much more common with real data. Generally, larger values of a variable are associated with larger spread.</p>
<p>We transform <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> using <span class="math inline">\(y^{*} = y^{\lambda}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> chosen based on whether the variance of the residuals is increasing or decreasing with fitted response:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Figure <!-- inc -->, choose <span class="math inline">\(\lambda &lt; 1\)</span>.
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 0\)</span>, it means we use a logarithmic transformation with base e, i.e.Â <span class="math inline">\(y^* = \log(y)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Note that a logarithm with no base means a natural log, or ln.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For Figure <!-- dec -->, choose <span class="math inline">\(\lambda &gt; 1\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So based on the residual plot, we have a range of values for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.4.2</span> Box-Cox Plot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#box-cox-plot"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>We can use a Box-Cox plot to help us narrow the range of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> to use. It is a plot of the log-likelihood function against <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, and we choose <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> that maximizes this log-likelihood function. For example, Figure <!-- bcplot --> shows the Box Cox plot generated for the regression associated with the residual plot in Figure <!-- dec -->.</p>
<!-- Add figure here. boxcox.jpeg -->
<p>Notice an approximate 95% CI is provided for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. A few comments on how to use the Box-Cox plot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three vertical dashed lines are displayed: the middle line corresponds to the optimal value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>; the other two lines are the lower and upper bounds of a 95% CI for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.</li>
<li>We choose <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> within the CI (or even close to it) that is easy to understand. We do not have to choose the optimal value, especially if its value is difficult to interpret. In this example, I will choose <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 2\)</span>, so a square transformation for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Transform response with <span class="math inline">\(y^* = y^2\)</span>. Regress <span class="math inline">\(y^*\)</span> against <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</li>
<li>If 1 lies in the CI, <strong>no transformation</strong> on <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> may be needed.</li>
<li>If a transformation is needed, a <strong>log transformation</strong> is preferred, since we can still interpret the estimated coefficients. It is difficult to interpret with any other type of transformation.</li>
<li>View the Box-Cox procedure as a guide for selecting a transformation, rather than being definitive.</li>
<li>Need to recheck the residuals after every transformation to assess if the transformation worked.</li>

<p>A log transformation on the response is preferred over any other transformation, as we can still interpret regression coefficients. A couple of ways to interpret the estimated slope <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_1\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The predicted response variable is <strong>multiplied by a factor</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(\exp(\hat{\beta_1})\)</span> for a one-unit increase in the predictor.</li>

<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_1\)</span> is positive, we have a percent <strong>increase</strong>. The predicted response variable increases by <span class="math inline">\((\exp(\hat{\beta_1}) - 1) \times 100\)</span> percent for a one-unit increase in the predictor.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_1\)</span> is negative, we have a percent <strong>decrease</strong>. The predicted response variable decreases by <span class="math inline">\((1 - \exp(\hat{\beta_1})) \times 100\)</span> percent for a one-unit increase in the predictor.</li>

</h2>
<p>We first ensure the variance has been stabilized and assumption 2 is met. If <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> does not accurately capture the relationship between the variables, we transform the predictor variable to meet assumption 1. Some writers call this a linearization transformation, as we seek to make the transformed version of the predictor variable, <span class="math inline">\(x^*\)</span>, to be approximately linear with the response variable (or transformed <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>), i.e.Â <span class="math inline">\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x^* + \epsilon\)</span>. We do not consider transforming the response variable to deal with assumption 1, as transforming the response variable is likely to reintroduce violation of assumption 2.</p>
<p>The general strategy on how to transform the predictor is via a scatterplot of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(y^*\)</span>) against <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. We use the pattern seen in the plot to decide how to transform the predictor. Some examples are shown in Figure <!-- xstar --> below.</p>

</h3>
<p>One thing to be aware of is the <strong>hierarchical principle</strong>: if the relationship between the response and predictor is of a higher order polynomial (e.g.Â quadratic, cubic), the hierarchical principle states that the lower order terms should remain in the model. For example, if the relationship is of order <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, fit <span class="math inline">\(y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + \cdots + \beta_h x^h + \epsilon\)</span> via a multiple linear regression framework.

<p>A log transformation on the predictor is preferred over any other transformation, as we can still interpret the regression coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_1\)</span>, in a couple of ways:</p>
