[["index.html", "Linear Models for Data Science Preface", " Linear Models for Data Science Jeffrey Woo 2024-06-27 Preface There are many books on linear models, with various expectations for different levels of familiarity with statistical, mathematical, and coding concepts. These books generally fall into one of two camps: Little to no familiarity with statistical and mathematical concepts, but fairly familiar to coding. These books tend to be written for programmers who want to get into data science. These books tend to explain linear models while trying to avoid statistical and mathematical concepts as much, only covering these concepts if absolutely necessary. These books tend to present linear models in a recipe format giving readers directions on what to do to build their models. The drawback of such books is that readers do not get much understanding of the underlying concepts of linear models. It is impossible to give directions covering every possible scenario in the real world as real data are messy. Practitioners of data science often have to think outside the box in order to make linear models work for their particular data, and it is difficult to do so without understanding the mathematical framework of linear models. Familiarity with mathematical notation and introductory statistical concepts such as statistical inference, and little to no familiarity with coding. These books tend to be written for mathematicians (or anyone with a strong background in mathematics) who want to get into data science. These books cover the mathematical framework of linear models thoroughly. The drawback of such books is that readers must be comfortable with mathematical notation. This limits the audience for such books to people with fairly thorough training in mathematics. People without such training will get lost trying to read such books, and do not understand why we need to know the mathematical foundations to use linear models in data science. This book is meant to be readable by both groups of readers. Some foundational mathematical knowledge will be presented, but will be written so that is readable by anyone. This book will also explain what these knowledge mean in the context of data science. Practical advice, based on the foundational mathematical knowledge, will also be given. This book accompanies the course STAT 6021: Linear Models for Data Science, for the Masters of Data Science (MSDS) program at the University of Virginia School of Data Science. As introductory statistics and introductory programming are pre-requisites for entering the MSDS program, this book assumes basic knowledge of statistical inference and coding. Review materials covering these concepts are provided separately for enrolled students.

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!
