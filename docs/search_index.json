There are many books on linear models, with various expectations for different levels of familiarity with statistical, mathematical, and coding concepts. These books generally fall into one of two camps: Little to no familiarity with statistical and mathematical concepts, but fairly familiar to coding. These books tend to be written for programmers who want to get into data science. These books tend to explain linear models while trying to avoid statistical and mathematical concepts as much, only covering these concepts if absolutely necessary. These books tend to present linear models in a recipe format giving readers directions on what to do to build their models. The drawback of such books is that readers do not get much understanding of the underlying concepts of linear models. It is impossible to give directions covering every possible scenario in the real world as real data are messy. Practitioners of data science often have to think outside the box in order to make linear models work for their particular data, and it is difficult to do so without understanding the mathematical framework of linear models. Familiarity with mathematical notation and introductory statistical concepts such as statistical inference, and little to no familiarity with coding. These books tend to be written for mathematicians (or anyone with a strong background in mathematics) who want to get into data science. These books cover the mathematical framework of linear models thoroughly. The drawback of such books is that readers must be comfortable with mathematical notation. This limits the audience for such books to people with fairly thorough training in mathematics. People without such training will get lost trying to read such books, and do not understand why we need to know the mathematical foundations to use linear models in data science. This book is meant to be readable by both groups of readers. Some foundational mathematical knowledge will be presented, but will be written so that is readable by anyone. This book will also explain what these knowledge mean in the context of data science. Practical advice, based on the foundational mathematical knowledge, will also be given. This book accompanies the course STAT 6021: Linear Models for Data Science, for the Masters of Data Science (MSDS) program at the University of Virginia School of Data Science. As introductory statistics and introductory programming are pre-requisites for entering the MSDS program, this book assumes basic knowledge of statistical inference and coding. Review materials covering these concepts are provided separately for enrolled students. Data sets used I have tried to use as many open source data sets as much as possible so that readers can work on the various examples I have provided on their own. However, some data sets may not be open source and have come from my experience teaching this class since 2019 (and variations of the class since 2013), and have used some data sets that were shared by other statistics and data science educators. It is my goal to eventually use only open source data sets.

When we read data in to R, they are typically stored as a data frame. A data frame can be viewed like an EXCEL spreadsheet, where data are stored in rows and columns. Before performing any analysis, we want the data frame to have this basic structure: Each row of the data frame corresponds to an observation. Each column of the data frame corresponds to a variable. Sometimes, data are not structured in this way, and we will have to transform the data to take on this basic data structure. This process is called data wrangling. The most common and basic operations to transform the data are: Selecting a subset of columns of the data frame. Selecting a subset of rows of the data frame based on some criteria. Change column names. Find missing data. Create new variables based on existing variables. Combine multiple data frames. We will explore two approaches to data wrangling: Using functions that already come pre-loaded with R (sometimes called base R). Using functions from the dplyr package. These two approaches are quite different but can achieve the same goals in data wrangling. Each user of R usually ends up with their own preferred way of performing data wrangling operations, but it is important to know both approaches so you are able to work with a broader audience. 1.2 Data Wrangling using Base R Functions We will use the dataset ClassDataPrevious.csv as an example. The data were collected from an introductory statistics class at UVa from a previous semester. Download the dataset from Canvas and read it into R. Data&lt;-read.csv(&quot;ClassDataPrevious.csv&quot;, header=TRUE) We check the number of rows and columns in this dataframe. dim(Data) ## [1] 298 8 There are 298 rows and 8 columns: so we have 298 students and 8 variables. We can also check the names for each column. colnames(Data) ## [1] &quot;Year&quot; &quot;Sleep&quot; &quot;Sport&quot; &quot;Courses&quot; &quot;Major&quot; &quot;Age&quot; &quot;Computer&quot; ## [8] &quot;Lunch&quot; The variables are: Year: the year the student is in Sleep: how much sleep the student averages a night (in hours) Sport: the student’s favorite sport Courses: how many courses the student is taking in the semester Major: the student’s major Age: the student’s age (in years) Computer: the operating system the student uses (Mac or PC) Lunch: how much the student usually spends on lunch (in dollars) 1.2.1 View specific row(s) and/or column(s) of a data frame We can view specific rows and/or columns of any data frame using the square brackets [], for example: Data[1,2] ##row index first, then column index ## [1] 8 The row index is listed first, then the column index, in the square brackets. This means the first student sleeps 8 hours a night. We can also view multiple rows and columns, for example: Data[c(1,3,4),c(1,5,8)] ## Year Major Lunch ## 1 Second Commerce 11 ## 3 Second Cognitive science and psychology 10 ## 4 First Pre-Comm 4 to view the 1st, 5th, and 8th variables for observations 1, 3, and 4. There are several ways to view a specific column. For example, to view the 1st column (which is the variable called Year): Data$Year ##or Data[,1] ##or Data[,-c(2:8)] Note the comma separates the indices for the row and column. An empty value before the comma means we want all the rows, and then the specific column. To view multiple columns, for example the first four columns: Data[,1:4] Data[,c(1,2,3,4)] To view the values of certain rows, we can use Data[c(1,3),] to view the values for observations 1 and 3. An empty value after the comma means we want all the columns for those specific rows. 1.2.2 Select observations by condition(s) We may want to only analyze certain subsets of our data, based on some conditions. For example, we may only want to analyze students whose favorite sport is soccer. The which() function in R helps us find the indices associated with a condition being met. For example: which(Data$Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot;) ## [1] 3 20 25 26 31 32 33 38 44 46 48 50 51 64 67 71 87 92 98 ## [20] 99 118 122 124 126 128 133 136 137 143 146 153 159 165 174 197 198 207 211 ## [39] 214 226 234 241 255 259 260 266 274 278 281 283 294 295 informs us which rows belong to observations whose favorite sport is soccer, i.e. the 3rd, 20th, 25th (and so on) students. We can create a new data frame that contains only students whose favorite sport is soccer: SoccerPeeps&lt;-Data[which(Data$Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot;),] dim(SoccerPeeps) ## [1] 52 8 We are extracting the rows which satisfy the condition, favorite sport being soccer, and storing these rows into a new data frame called SoccerPeeps. We can see that this new data frame has 52 observations. Suppose we want to have a data frame that satisfies two conditions: that the favorite sport is soccer and they are 2nd years at UVa. We can type: SoccerPeeps_2nd&lt;-Data[which(Data$Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot; &amp; Data$Year==&quot;Second&quot;),] dim(SoccerPeeps_2nd) ## [1] 25 8 This new data frame SoccerPeeps_2nd has 25 observations. We can also set conditions based on numeric variables, for example, we want students who sleep more than eight hours a night Sleepy&lt;-Data[which(Data$Sleep&gt;8),] We can also create a data frame that contains students who satisfy at least one out of two conditions, for example, the favorite sport is soccer or they sleep more than 8 hours a night: Sleepy_or_Soccer&lt;-Data[which(Data$Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot; | Data$Sleep&gt;8),] 1.2.3 Change column name(s) For some datasets, the names of the columns are complicated or do not make sense. We should always give descriptive names to columns that make sense. For this dataset, the names are self-explanatory so we do not really need to change them. As an example, suppose we want to change the name of the 7th column from Computer to Comp: names(Data)[7]&lt;-&quot;Comp&quot; To change the names of multiples columns (for example, the 1st and 7th columns), type: names(Data)[c(1,7)]&lt;-c(&quot;Yr&quot;,&quot;Computer&quot;) 1.2.4 Find and remove missing data There are a few ways to locate missing data. Using the is.na() function directly on a data frame produces a lot of output that can be messy to view: is.na(Data) On the other hand, using the complete.cases() function is more pleasing to view: Data[!complete.cases(Data),] ## Yr Sleep Sport Courses Major ## 103 Second NA Basketball 7 psychology and youth and social innovation ## 206 Second 8 None 4 Cognitive Science ## Age Computer Lunch ## 103 19 Mac 10 ## 206 19 Mac NA The code above will extract rows that are not complete cases, in other words, rows that have missing entries. The output informs us observation 103 has a missing value for Sleep, and observation 206 has a missing value for Lunch. If you want to remove observations with a missing value, you can use one of the following two lines of code to create new data frames with the rows with missing values removed: Data_nomiss&lt;-na.omit(Data) ##or Data_nomiss2&lt;-Data[complete.cases(Data),] A word of caution: these lines of code will remove the entire row as long as at least a column has missing entries. As noted earlier, observation 103 has a missing value for only the Sleep variable. But this observation still provides information on the other variables, which are now removed. 1.2.5 Summarizing variable(s) Very often, we want to obtain some characteristics of our data. A common way to summarize a numerical variable is to find its mean. We have four numerical variables in our data frame, which are in columns 2, 4, 6, and 8. To find the mean of all four numerical variables, we can use the apply() function: apply(Data[,c(2,4,6,8)],2,mean) ## Sleep Courses Age Lunch ## NA 5.016779 19.573826 NA apply(Data[,c(2,4,6,8)],2,mean,na.rm=T) ## Sleep Courses Age Lunch ## 155.559259 5.016779 19.573826 156.594175 Notice that due to the missing values, the first line has NA for some of the variables. The second line includes an optional argument, na.rm=T, which will remove the observations with an NA value for the variable from the calculation of the mean. There are at least 3 arguments that are supplied to the apply() function: The first argument is a data frame containing all the variables which we want to find the mean of. In this case, we want columns 2, 4, 6, and 8 of the data frame Data. The second argument takes on the value 1 or 2. Since we want to find the mean of columns, rather than rows, we type 2. If want to mean of a row, we will type 1. The third argument specifies the name of the function you want to apply to the columns of the supplied data frame. In this case, we want the mean. We can change this to find the median, standard deviation, etc, of these numeric variables if we want to. We notice the means for some of the variables are suspiciously high, so looking at the medians will be more informative. apply(Data[,c(2,4,6,8)],2,median,na.rm=T) ## Sleep Courses Age Lunch ## 7.5 5.0 19.0 9.0 1.2.6 Summarizing variable by groups Sometimes we want to summarize a variable by groups. Suppose we want to find the median amount of sleep separately for 1st years, 2nd years, 3rd years, and 4th years get. We can use the tapply() function: tapply(Data$Sleep,Data$Yr,median,na.rm=T) ## First Fourth Second Third ## 8.0 7.0 7.5 7.0 This informs us the median amount of sleep first years get is 8 hours a night; for fourth years the median amount is 7 hours a night. There are at least 3 arguments that are supplied to the tapply() function: The first argument contains the vector which we want to summarize. The second argument contains the factor which we use to subset our data. In this example, we want to subset according to Yr. The third argument is the function which we want to apply to each subset of our data. The fourth argument is optional, in this case, we want to remove observations with missing values from the calculation of the mean. Notice the output orders the factor levels in alphabetical order. For our context, it is better to rearrange the levels to First, Second, Third, Fourth using the factor() function: Data$Yr&lt;-factor(Data$Yr, levels=c(&quot;First&quot;,&quot;Second&quot;,&quot;Third&quot;,&quot;Fourth&quot;)) levels(Data$Yr) ## [1] &quot;First&quot; &quot;Second&quot; &quot;Third&quot; &quot;Fourth&quot; tapply(Data$Sleep,Data$Yr,median,na.rm=T) ##much nicer ## First Second Third Fourth ## 8.0 7.5 7.0 7.0 This output makes a lot more sense for this context. If we want to summarize a variable on groups formed by more than one variable, we need to adjust the second argument in the tapply() function by creating a list. Suppose we want to find the median sleep hour based on the Yr and the preferred operating system of the observations, tapply(Data$Sleep,list(Data$Yr,Data$Computer),median,na.rm=T) ## Mac PC ## First NA 8.0 7.50 ## Second 7 7.5 7.50 ## Third NA 7.5 7.00 ## Fourth NA 7.0 7.25 Interestingly, it looks like there were observations who did not specify which operating system they use, hence the extra column in the output. 1.2.7 Create a new variable based on existing variable(s) Depending on the context of our analysis, we may need to create new variables based on existing variables. There are a few variations of this task, based on the type of variable you want to create, and the type of variable it is based on. 1.2.7.1 Create a numeric variable based on another numeric variable The variable Sleep is in number of hours. Suppose we need to convert the values of Sleep to number of minutes, we can simply perform the following mathematical operation: Sleep_mins&lt;-Data$Sleep * 60 and store the transformed variable into a vector called Sleep_mins. 1.2.7.2 Create a binary variable based on a numeric variable Suppose we want to create a binary variable (categorical variable with two levels), called deprived. An observation will obtain a value of “yes” if they sleep for less than 7 hours a night, and “no” otherwise. The ifelse() function is useful in creating binary variables: deprived&lt;-ifelse(Data$Sleep&lt;7, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;) There are 3 arguments associated with the ifelse() function: The first argument is the condition that we wish to use. The second argument is the value of the observation if the condition is true. The third argument is the value of the observation if the condition if false. 1.2.7.3 Create a categorical variable based on a numeric variable Suppose we want to create a categorical variable based on the number of courses a student takes. We will call this new variable CourseLoad, which takes on the following values: light if 3 courses or less, regular if 4 or 5 courses, heavy if more than 5 courses . The cut() function is used in this situation CourseLoad&lt;-cut(Data$Courses, breaks = c(-Inf, 3, 5, Inf), labels = c(&quot;light&quot;, &quot;regular&quot;, &quot;heavy&quot;)) There are three arguments that are applied to the cut() function: The first argument is the vector which you are basing the new variable on. The argument breaks lists how you want to set the intervals associated with Data$Courses. In this case, we are creating three intervals: one from \\((-\\infty, 3]\\), another from \\((3, 5]\\), and the last interval from \\((5, \\infty]\\). The argument labels gives the label for CourseLoad associated with each interval. 1.2.7.4 Collapse levels Sometimes, a categorical variable has more levels than we need for our analysis, and we want to collapse some levels. For example, the variable Yr has four levels: First, Second, Third, and Fourth. Perhaps we are more interested in comparing upperclassmen and underclassmen, so we want to collapse First and Second years into underclassmen, and Third and Fourth years into upperclassmen: levels(Data$Yr) ## [1] &quot;First&quot; &quot;Second&quot; &quot;Third&quot; &quot;Fourth&quot; new.levels&lt;-c(&quot;und&quot;, &quot;und&quot;, &quot;up&quot;,&quot;up&quot;) Year2&lt;-factor(new.levels[Data$Yr]) levels(Year2) ## [1] &quot;und&quot; &quot;up&quot; The levels associated with the variable Yr are ordered as First, Second, Third, Fourth. The character vector new.levels has under as the first two characters, and upper as the last two characters to correspond to the original levels in the variable Yr. The new variable is called Year2. 1.2.8 Combine data frames We have created four new variables, Sleep_mins, deprived, CourseLoad, and Year2, based on previously existing variables. Since these variables are all based on the same observations, we can combine them with an existing data frame using the data.frame() function: Data&lt;-data.frame(Data,Sleep_mins,deprived,CourseLoad,Year2) head(Data) ## Yr Sleep Sport Courses Major Age Computer ## 1 Second 8 Basketball 6 Commerce 19 Mac ## 2 Second 7 Tennis 5 Psychology 19 Mac ## 3 Second 8 Soccer 5 Cognitive science and psychology 21 Mac ## 4 First 9 Basketball 5 Pre-Comm 19 Mac ## 5 Second 4 Basketball 6 Statistics 19 PC ## 6 Third 7 None 4 Psychology 20 PC ## Lunch Sleep_mins deprived CourseLoad Year2 ## 1 11 480 no heavy und ## 2 10 420 no regular und ## 3 10 480 no regular und ## 4 4 540 no regular und ## 5 0 240 yes heavy und ## 6 11 420 no regular up Notice that since we listed the four new variables after Data in the data.frame() function, they appear after the original columns in the data frame. Alternatively, we can use the cbind() function which gives the same data frame: Data2&lt;-cbind(Data,Sleep_mins,deprived,CourseLoad,Year2) If you are combining data frames which have different observations but the same columns, we can merge them using rbind(): dat1&lt;-Data[1:3,1:3] dat3&lt;-Data[6:8,1:3] res.dat2&lt;-rbind(dat1,dat3) head(res.dat2) ## Yr Sleep Sport ## 1 Second 8 Basketball ## 2 Second 7 Tennis ## 3 Second 8 Soccer ## 6 Third 7 None ## 7 Second 7 Basketball ## 8 First 7 Basketball 1.2.9 Export data frame in R to a .csv file To export a data frame to a .csv file, type: write.csv(Data, file=&quot;newdata.csv&quot;, row.names = FALSE) A file newdata.csv will be created in the working directory. Note that by default, the argument row.names is set to be TRUE. This will add a column in the dataframe which is an index number. I do not find this step useful in most analyses so I almost always set row.names to be FALSE. 1.2.10 Sort data frame by column values To sort your data frame in ascending order by Age: Data_by_age&lt;-Data[order(Data$Age),] To sort in descending order by Age: Data_by_age_des&lt;-Data[order(-Data$Age),] To sort in ascending order by Age first, then by Sleep: Data_by_age_sleep&lt;-Data[order(Data$Age, Data$Sleep),] 1.3 Data Wrangling Using dplyr Functions In the previous section, we were performing data wrangling operations using functions that are built in with base R. In this module, we will be using functions mostly from a package called dplyr, which can perform the same operations as well. Before performing data wrangling operations, let us clear our environment, so that previously declared objects are removed. This allows us to start with a clean slate, which is often desirable when starting on a new analysis. This is done via: rm(list = ls()) The dplyr package is a subset of the tidyverse package, so we can access these functions after installing and loading either package. After installing the tidyverse package, load it by typing: ##library(dplyr) or library(tidyverse) The dplyr package was developed to make the syntax more intuitive to a broader range of R users, primarily through the use of pipes. However, the code involved with functions from dlpyr tends to be longer than code involved with base R functions, and there are more functions to learn with dplyr. You will find a lot of articles on the internet by various R users about why each of them believes one approach to be superior to the other. I am not fussy about which approach you use as long as you can perform the necessary operations. It is to your benefit to be familiar with both approaches so you can work with a broader range of R users. We will continue to use the dataset ClassDataPrevious.csv as an example. Download the dataset from Canvas and read it into R: Data&lt;-read.csv(&quot;ClassDataPrevious.csv&quot;, header=TRUE) In the examples below, we are performing the same operations as in the previous section, but using dplyr functions instead of base R functions. 1.3.1 Select specific column(s) of a data frame The select() function is used to select specific columns. There are a couple of ways to use this function. First: select(Data,Year) to select the column Year from the data frame called Data. 1.3.1.1 Pipes Alternatively, we can use pipes: Data%&gt;% select(Year) Pipes in R are typed using %&gt;% or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + M on your keyboard. To think of the operations above, we can read the code as take the data frame called Data and then select the column named Year. We can interpret a pipe as “and then”. Commands after a pipe should be placed on a new line (press enter). Pipes are especially useful if we want to execute several commands in sequence, which we will see in later examples. 1.3.2 Select observations by condition(s) The filter() function allows us to subset our data based on some conditions, for example, to select students whose favorite sport is soccer: filter(Data, Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot;) We can create a new data frame called SoccerPeeps that contains students whose favorite sport is soccer: SoccerPeeps&lt;-Data%&gt;% filter(Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot;) Suppose we want to have a data frame, called SoccerPeeps_2nd, that satisfies two conditions: that the favorite sport is soccer and they are 2nd years at UVa: SoccerPeeps_2nd&lt;-Data%&gt;% filter(Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot; &amp; Year==&quot;Second&quot;) We can also set conditions based on numeric variables, for example, we want the students who sleep more than eight hours a night: Sleepy&lt;-Data%&gt;% filter(Sleep&gt;8) We can also create a data frame that contains observations as long as they satisfy at least one out of two conditions: the favorite sport is soccer or they sleep more than 8 hours a night: Sleepy_or_Soccer&lt;-Data%&gt;% filter(Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot; | Sleep&gt;8) 1.3.3 Change column name(s) It is straightforward to change the names of columns using the rename() function. For example: Data&lt;-Data%&gt;% rename(Yr=Year, Comp=Computer) allows us to change the name of two columns: from Year and Computer to Yr and Comp. 1.3.4 Summarizing variable(s) The summarize() function allows us to summarize a column. Suppose we want to find the mean value of the numeric columns: Sleep, Courses, Age, and Lunch: Data%&gt;% summarize(mean(Sleep,na.rm = T),mean(Courses),mean(Age),mean(Lunch,na.rm = T)) ## mean(Sleep, na.rm = T) mean(Courses) mean(Age) mean(Lunch, na.rm = T) ## 1 155.5593 5.016779 19.57383 156.5942 The output looks a bit cumbersome. We can give names to each summary Data%&gt;% summarize(avgSleep=mean(Sleep,na.rm = T),avgCourse=mean(Courses),avgAge=mean(Age), avgLun=mean(Lunch,na.rm = T)) ## avgSleep avgCourse avgAge avgLun ## 1 155.5593 5.016779 19.57383 156.5942 As mentioned previously, the means look suspiciously high for a couple of variables, so looking at the medians may be more informative: Data%&gt;% summarize(medSleep=median(Sleep,na.rm = T),medCourse=median(Courses), medAge=median(Age),medLun=median(Lunch,na.rm = T)) ## medSleep medCourse medAge medLun ## 1 7.5 5 19 9 Note: For a lot of functions in the dplyr package, using American spelling or British spelling works. So we can use summarise() instead of summarize(). 1.3.5 Summarizing variable by groups Suppose we want to find the median amount of sleep 1st years, 2nd years, 3rd years, and 4th years get. We can use the group_by() function: Data%&gt;% group_by(Yr)%&gt;% summarize(medSleep=median(Sleep,na.rm=T)) ## # A tibble: 4 × 2 ## Yr medSleep ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 First 8 ## 2 Fourth 7 ## 3 Second 7.5 ## 4 Third 7 The way to read the code above is Get the data frame called Data, and then group the observations by Yr, and then find the median amount of sleep by each Yr and store the median in a vector called medSleep. As seen previously, the ordering of the factor levels is in alphabetical order. For our context, it is better to rearrange the levels to First, Second, Third, Fourth. We can use the mutate() function whenever we want to transform or create a new variable. In this case, we are transforming the variable Yr by reordering the factor levels with the fct_relevel() function: Data&lt;- Data%&gt;% mutate(Yr = Yr%&gt;% fct_relevel(c(&quot;First&quot;,&quot;Second&quot;,&quot;Third&quot;,&quot;Fourth&quot;))) Get the data frame called Data, and then transform the variable called Yr, and then reorder the factor levels. Then, we use pipes, the group_by(), and summarize() functions like before: Data%&gt;% group_by(Yr)%&gt;% summarize(medSleep=median(Sleep,na.rm=T)) ## # A tibble: 4 × 2 ## Yr medSleep ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 First 8 ## 2 Second 7.5 ## 3 Third 7 ## 4 Fourth 7 This output makes a lot more sense for this context. To summarize a variable on groups formed by more than one variable, we just add the other variables in the group_by() function: Data%&gt;% group_by(Yr,Comp)%&gt;% summarize(medSleep=median(Sleep,na.rm=T)) ## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;Yr&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` ## argument. ## # A tibble: 9 × 3 ## # Groups: Yr [4] ## Yr Comp medSleep ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 First &quot;Mac&quot; 8 ## 2 First &quot;PC&quot; 7.5 ## 3 Second &quot;&quot; 7 ## 4 Second &quot;Mac&quot; 7.5 ## 5 Second &quot;PC&quot; 7.5 ## 6 Third &quot;Mac&quot; 7.5 ## 7 Third &quot;PC&quot; 7 ## 8 Fourth &quot;Mac&quot; 7 ## 9 Fourth &quot;PC&quot; 7.25 1.3.6 Create a new variable based on existing variable(s) As mentioned in the previously, the mutate() function is used to transform a variable or to create a new variable. There are a few variations of this task, based on the type of variable you want to create, and the type of variable it is based on. 1.3.6.1 Create a numeric variable based on another numeric variable The variable Sleep is in number of hours. Suppose we need to convert the values of Sleep to number of minutes, we can simply perform the following mathematical operation: Data&lt;-Data%&gt;% mutate(Sleep_mins = Sleep*60) and store the transformed variable called Sleep_mins and add Sleep_mins to the data frame called Data. 1.3.6.2 Create a binary variable based on a numeric variable Suppose we want to create a binary variable , called deprived. An observation will obtain a value of yes if they sleep for less than 7 hours a night, and no otherwise. We will then add this variable deprived to the data frame called Data: Data&lt;-Data%&gt;% mutate(deprived=ifelse(Sleep&lt;7, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) 1.3.6.3 Create a categorical variable based on a numeric variable Suppose we want to create a categorical variable based on the number of courses a student takes. We will call this new variable CourseLoad, which takes on the following values: light if 3 courses or less, regular if 4 or 5 courses, heavy if more than 5 courses and then add CourseLoad to the data frame Data. We can use the case_when() function from the dplyr package, instead of the cut() function: Data&lt;-Data%&gt;% mutate(CourseLoad=case_when(Courses &lt;= 3 ~ &quot;light&quot;, Courses &gt;3 &amp; Courses &lt;=5 ~ &quot;regular&quot;, Courses &gt; 5 ~ &quot;heavy&quot;)) Notice how the names of the categorical variable are supplied after a specific condition is specified. 1.3.6.4 Collapsing levels Sometimes, a categorical variable has more levels than we need for our analysis, and we want to collapse some levels. For example, the variable Yr has four levels: First, Second, Third, and Fourth. Perhaps we are more interested in comparing between upperclassmen and underclassmen, so we want to collapse First and Second Yrs into underclassmen, and Third and Fourth Yrs into upperclassmen. We will use the fct_collapse() function: Data&lt;-Data%&gt;% mutate(UpUnder=fct_collapse(Yr,under=c(&quot;First&quot;,&quot;Second&quot;),up=c(&quot;Third&quot;,&quot;Fourth&quot;))) We are creating a new variable called UpUnder, which is done by collapsing First and Second into a new factor called under, and collapsing Third and Fourth into a new factor called up. UpUnder is also added to the data frame Data. 1.3.7 Combine data frames To combine data frames which have different observations but the same columns, we can combine them using bind_rows(): dat1&lt;-Data[1:3,1:3] dat3&lt;-Data[6:8,1:3] res.dat2&lt;-bind_rows(dat1,dat3) head(res.dat2) ## Yr Sleep Sport ## 1 Second 8 Basketball ## 2 Second 7 Tennis ## 3 Second 8 Soccer ## 4 Third 7 None ## 5 Second 7 Basketball ## 6 First 7 Basketball bind_rows() works the same way as rbind(). Likewise, we can use bind_cols() instead of cbind(). 1.3.8 Sort data frame by column values To sort your data frame in ascending order by Age: Data_by_age&lt;-Data%&gt;% arrange(Age) To sort in descending order by Age: Data_by_age_des&lt;-Data%&gt;% arrange(desc(Age)) To sort in ascending order by Age first, then by Sleep: Data_by_age_sleep&lt;-Data%&gt;% arrange(Age,Sleep) "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1.
