There are many books on linear models, with various expectations for different levels of familiarity with statistical, mathematical, and coding concepts. These books generally fall into one of two camps: Little to no familiarity with statistical and mathematical concepts, but fairly familiar to coding. These books tend to be written for programmers who want to get into data science. These books tend to explain linear models while trying to avoid statistical and mathematical concepts as much, only covering these concepts if absolutely necessary. These books tend to present linear models in a recipe format giving readers directions on what to do to build their models. The drawback of such books is that readers do not get much understanding of the underlying concepts of linear models. It is impossible to give directions covering every possible scenario in the real world as real data are messy. Practitioners of data science often have to think outside the box in order to make linear models work for their particular data, and it is difficult to do so without understanding the mathematical framework of linear models. Familiarity with mathematical notation and introductory statistical concepts such as statistical inference, and little to no familiarity with coding. These books tend to be written for mathematicians (or anyone with a strong background in mathematics) who want to get into data science. These books cover the mathematical framework of linear models thoroughly. The drawback of such books is that readers must be comfortable with mathematical notation. This limits the audience for such books to people with fairly thorough training in mathematics. People without such training will get lost trying to read such books, and do not understand why we need to know the mathematical foundations to use linear models in data science. This book is meant to be readable by both groups of readers. Some foundational mathematical knowledge will be presented, but will be written so that is readable by anyone. This book will also explain what these knowledge mean in the context of data science. Practical advice, based on the foundational mathematical knowledge, will also be given. This book accompanies the course STAT 6021: Linear Models for Data Science, for the Masters of Data Science (MSDS) program at the University of Virginia School of Data Science. As introductory statistics and introductory programming are pre-requisites for entering the MSDS program, this book assumes basic knowledge of statistical inference and coding. Review materials covering these concepts are provided separately for enrolled students. Data sets used I have tried to use as many open source data sets as much as possible so that readers can work on the various examples I have provided on their own. However, some data sets may not be open source and have come from my experience teaching this class since 2019 (and variations of the class since 2013), and have used some data sets that were shared by other statistics and data science educators. It is my goal to eventually use only open source data sets.

When we read data in to R, they are typically stored as a data frame. A data frame can be viewed like an EXCEL spreadsheet, where data are stored in rows and columns. Before performing any analysis, we want the data frame to have this basic structure: Each row of the data frame corresponds to an observation. Each column of the data frame corresponds to a variable. Sometimes, data are not structured in this way, and we will have to transform the data to take on this basic data structure. This process is called data wrangling. The most common and basic operations to transform the data are: Selecting a subset of columns of the data frame. Selecting a subset of rows of the data frame based on some criteria. Change column names. Find missing data. Create new variables based on existing variables. Combine multiple data frames. We will explore two approaches to data wrangling: Using functions that already come pre-loaded with R (sometimes called base R). Using functions from the dplyr package. These two approaches are quite different but can achieve the same goals in data wrangling. Each user of R usually ends up with their own preferred way of performing data wrangling operations, but it is important to know both approaches so you are able to work with a broader audience. 1.2 Data Wrangling using Base R Functions We will use the dataset ClassDataPrevious.csv as an example. The data were collected from an introductory statistics class at UVa from a previous semester. Download the dataset from Canvas and read it into R. Data&lt;-read.csv(&quot;ClassDataPrevious.csv&quot;, header=TRUE) We check the number of rows and columns in this dataframe. dim(Data) ## [1] 298 8 There are 298 rows and 8 columns: so we have 298 students and 8 variables. We can also check the names for each column. colnames(Data) ## [1] &quot;Year&quot; &quot;Sleep&quot; &quot;Sport&quot; &quot;Courses&quot; &quot;Major&quot; &quot;Age&quot; &quot;Computer&quot; ## [8] &quot;Lunch&quot; The variables are: Year: the year the student is in Sleep: how much sleep the student averages a night (in hours) Sport: the student’s favorite sport Courses: how many courses the student is taking in the semester Major: the student’s major Age: the student’s age (in years) Computer: the operating system the student uses (Mac or PC) Lunch: how much the student usually spends on lunch (in dollars) 1.2.1 View specific row(s) and/or column(s) of a data frame We can view specific rows and/or columns of any data frame using the square brackets [], for example: Data[1,2] ##row index first, then column index ## [1] 8 The row index is listed first, then the column index, in the square brackets. This means the first student sleeps 8 hours a night. We can also view multiple rows and columns, for example: Data[c(1,3,4),c(1,5,8)] ## Year Major Lunch ## 1 Second Commerce 11 ## 3 Second Cognitive science and psychology 10 ## 4 First Pre-Comm 4 to view the 1st, 5th, and 8th variables for observations 1, 3, and 4. There are several ways to view a specific column. For example, to view the 1st column (which is the variable called Year): Data$Year ##or Data[,1] ##or Data[,-c(2:8)] Note the comma separates the indices for the row and column. An empty value before the comma means we want all the rows, and then the specific column. To view multiple columns, for example the first four columns: Data[,1:4] Data[,c(1,2,3,4)] To view the values of certain rows, we can use Data[c(1,3),] to view the values for observations 1 and 3. An empty value after the comma means we want all the columns for those specific rows. 1.2.2 Select observations by condition(s) We may want to only analyze certain subsets of our data, based on some conditions. For example, we may only want to analyze students whose favorite sport is soccer. The which() function in R helps us find the indices associated with a condition being met. For example: which(Data$Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot;) ## [1] 3 20 25 26 31 32 33 38 44 46 48 50 51 64 67 71 87 92 98 ## [20] 99 118 122 124 126 128 133 136 137 143 146 153 159 165 174 197 198 207 211 ## [39] 214 226 234 241 255 259 260 266 274 278 281 283 294 295 informs us which rows belong to observations whose favorite sport is soccer, i.e. the 3rd, 20th, 25th (and so on) students. We can create a new data frame that contains only students whose favorite sport is soccer: SoccerPeeps&lt;-Data[which(Data$Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot;),] dim(SoccerPeeps) ## [1] 52 8 We are extracting the rows which satisfy the condition, favorite sport being soccer, and storing these rows into a new data frame called SoccerPeeps. We can see that this new data frame has 52 observations. Suppose we want to have a data frame that satisfies two conditions: that the favorite sport is soccer and they are 2nd years at UVa. We can type: SoccerPeeps_2nd&lt;-Data[which(Data$Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot; &amp; Data$Year==&quot;Second&quot;),] dim(SoccerPeeps_2nd) ## [1] 25 8 This new data frame SoccerPeeps_2nd has 25 observations. We can also set conditions based on numeric variables, for example, we want students who sleep more than eight hours a night Sleepy&lt;-Data[which(Data$Sleep&gt;8),] We can also create a data frame that contains students who satisfy at least one out of two conditions, for example, the favorite sport is soccer or they sleep more than 8 hours a night: Sleepy_or_Soccer&lt;-Data[which(Data$Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot; | Data$Sleep&gt;8),] 1.2.3 Change column name(s) For some datasets, the names of the columns are complicated or do not make sense. We should always give descriptive names to columns that make sense. For this dataset, the names are self-explanatory so we do not really need to change them. As an example, suppose we want to change the name of the 7th column from Computer to Comp: names(Data)[7]&lt;-&quot;Comp&quot; To change the names of multiples columns (for example, the 1st and 7th columns), type: names(Data)[c(1,7)]&lt;-c(&quot;Yr&quot;,&quot;Computer&quot;) 1.2.4 Find and remove missing data There are a few ways to locate missing data. Using the is.na() function directly on a data frame produces a lot of output that can be messy to view: is.na(Data) On the other hand, using the complete.cases() function is more pleasing to view: Data[!complete.cases(Data),] ## Yr Sleep Sport Courses Major ## 103 Second NA Basketball 7 psychology and youth and social innovation ## 206 Second 8 None 4 Cognitive Science ## Age Computer Lunch ## 103 19 Mac 10 ## 206 19 Mac NA The code above will extract rows that are not complete cases, in other words, rows that have missing entries. The output informs us observation 103 has a missing value for Sleep, and observation 206 has a missing value for Lunch. If you want to remove observations with a missing value, you can use one of the following two lines of code to create new data frames with the rows with missing values removed: Data_nomiss&lt;-na.omit(Data) ##or Data_nomiss2&lt;-Data[complete.cases(Data),] A word of caution: these lines of code will remove the entire row as long as at least a column has missing entries. As noted earlier, observation 103 has a missing value for only the Sleep variable. But this observation still provides information on the other variables, which are now removed. 1.2.5 Summarizing variable(s) Very often, we want to obtain some characteristics of our data. A common way to summarize a numerical variable is to find its mean. We have four numerical variables in our data frame, which are in columns 2, 4, 6, and 8. To find the mean of all four numerical variables, we can use the apply() function: apply(Data[,c(2,4,6,8)],2,mean) ## Sleep Courses Age Lunch ## NA 5.016779 19.573826 NA apply(Data[,c(2,4,6,8)],2,mean,na.rm=T) ## Sleep Courses Age Lunch ## 155.559259 5.016779 19.573826 156.594175 Notice that due to the missing values, the first line has NA for some of the variables. The second line includes an optional argument, na.rm=T, which will remove the observations with an NA value for the variable from the calculation of the mean. There are at least 3 arguments that are supplied to the apply() function: The first argument is a data frame containing all the variables which we want to find the mean of. In this case, we want columns 2, 4, 6, and 8 of the data frame Data. The second argument takes on the value 1 or 2. Since we want to find the mean of columns, rather than rows, we type 2. If want to mean of a row, we will type 1. The third argument specifies the name of the function you want to apply to the columns of the supplied data frame. In this case, we want the mean. We can change this to find the median, standard deviation, etc, of these numeric variables if we want to. We notice the means for some of the variables are suspiciously high, so looking at the medians will be more informative. apply(Data[,c(2,4,6,8)],2,median,na.rm=T) ## Sleep Courses Age Lunch ## 7.5 5.0 19.0 9.0 1.2.6 Summarizing variable by groups Sometimes we want to summarize a variable by groups. Suppose we want to find the median amount of sleep separately for 1st years, 2nd years, 3rd years, and 4th years get. We can use the tapply() function: tapply(Data$Sleep,Data$Yr,median,na.rm=T) ## First Fourth Second Third ## 8.0 7.0 7.5 7.0 This informs us the median amount of sleep first years get is 8 hours a night; for fourth years the median amount is 7 hours a night. There are at least 3 arguments that are supplied to the tapply() function: The first argument contains the vector which we want to summarize. The second argument contains the factor which we use to subset our data. In this example, we want to subset according to Yr. The third argument is the function which we want to apply to each subset of our data. The fourth argument is optional, in this case, we want to remove observations with missing values from the calculation of the mean. Notice the output orders the factor levels in alphabetical order. For our context, it is better to rearrange the levels to First, Second, Third, Fourth using the factor() function: Data$Yr&lt;-factor(Data$Yr, levels=c(&quot;First&quot;,&quot;Second&quot;,&quot;Third&quot;,&quot;Fourth&quot;)) levels(Data$Yr) ## [1] &quot;First&quot; &quot;Second&quot; &quot;Third&quot; &quot;Fourth&quot; tapply(Data$Sleep,Data$Yr,median,na.rm=T) ##much nicer ## First Second Third Fourth ## 8.0 7.5 7.0 7.0 This output makes a lot more sense for this context. If we want to summarize a variable on groups formed by more than one variable, we need to adjust the second argument in the tapply() function by creating a list. Suppose we want to find the median sleep hour based on the Yr and the preferred operating system of the observations, tapply(Data$Sleep,list(Data$Yr,Data$Computer),median,na.rm=T) ## Mac PC ## First NA 8.0 7.50 ## Second 7 7.5 7.50 ## Third NA 7.5 7.00 ## Fourth NA 7.0 7.25 Interestingly, it looks like there were observations who did not specify which operating system they use, hence the extra column in the output. 1.2.7 Create a new variable based on existing variable(s) Depending on the context of our analysis, we may need to create new variables based on existing variables. There are a few variations of this task, based on the type of variable you want to create, and the type of variable it is based on. 1.2.7.1 Create a numeric variable based on another numeric variable The variable Sleep is in number of hours. Suppose we need to convert the values of Sleep to number of minutes, we can simply perform the following mathematical operation: Sleep_mins&lt;-Data$Sleep * 60 and store the transformed variable into a vector called Sleep_mins. 1.2.7.2 Create a binary variable based on a numeric variable Suppose we want to create a binary variable (categorical variable with two levels), called deprived. An observation will obtain a value of “yes” if they sleep for less than 7 hours a night, and “no” otherwise. The ifelse() function is useful in creating binary variables: deprived&lt;-ifelse(Data$Sleep&lt;7, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;) There are 3 arguments associated with the ifelse() function: The first argument is the condition that we wish to use. The second argument is the value of the observation if the condition is true. The third argument is the value of the observation if the condition if false. 1.2.7.3 Create a categorical variable based on a numeric variable Suppose we want to create a categorical variable based on the number of courses a student takes. We will call this new variable CourseLoad, which takes on the following values: light if 3 courses or less, regular if 4 or 5 courses, heavy if more than 5 courses . The cut() function is used in this situation CourseLoad&lt;-cut(Data$Courses, breaks = c(-Inf, 3, 5, Inf), labels = c(&quot;light&quot;, &quot;regular&quot;, &quot;heavy&quot;)) There are three arguments that are applied to the cut() function: The first argument is the vector which you are basing the new variable on. The argument breaks lists how you want to set the intervals associated with Data$Courses. In this case, we are creating three intervals: one from \\((-\\infty, 3]\\), another from \\((3, 5]\\), and the last interval from \\((5, \\infty]\\). The argument labels gives the label for CourseLoad associated with each interval. 1.2.7.4 Collapse levels Sometimes, a categorical variable has more levels than we need for our analysis, and we want to collapse some levels. For example, the variable Yr has four levels: First, Second, Third, and Fourth. Perhaps we are more interested in comparing upperclassmen and underclassmen, so we want to collapse First and Second years into underclassmen, and Third and Fourth years into upperclassmen: levels(Data$Yr) ## [1] &quot;First&quot; &quot;Second&quot; &quot;Third&quot; &quot;Fourth&quot; new.levels&lt;-c(&quot;und&quot;, &quot;und&quot;, &quot;up&quot;,&quot;up&quot;) Year2&lt;-factor(new.levels[Data$Yr]) levels(Year2) ## [1] &quot;und&quot; &quot;up&quot; The levels associated with the variable Yr are ordered as First, Second, Third, Fourth. The character vector new.levels has under as the first two characters, and upper as the last two characters to correspond to the original levels in the variable Yr. The new variable is called Year2. 1.2.8 Combine data frames We have created four new variables, Sleep_mins, deprived, CourseLoad, and Year2, based on previously existing variables. Since these variables are all based on the same observations, we can combine them with an existing data frame using the data.frame() function: Data&lt;-data.frame(Data,Sleep_mins,deprived,CourseLoad,Year2) head(Data) ## Yr Sleep Sport Courses Major Age Computer ## 1 Second 8 Basketball 6 Commerce 19 Mac ## 2 Second 7 Tennis 5 Psychology 19 Mac ## 3 Second 8 Soccer 5 Cognitive science and psychology 21 Mac ## 4 First 9 Basketball 5 Pre-Comm 19 Mac ## 5 Second 4 Basketball 6 Statistics 19 PC ## 6 Third 7 None 4 Psychology 20 PC ## Lunch Sleep_mins deprived CourseLoad Year2 ## 1 11 480 no heavy und ## 2 10 420 no regular und ## 3 10 480 no regular und ## 4 4 540 no regular und ## 5 0 240 yes heavy und ## 6 11 420 no regular up Notice that since we listed the four new variables after Data in the data.frame() function, they appear after the original columns in the data frame. Alternatively, we can use the cbind() function which gives the same data frame: Data2&lt;-cbind(Data,Sleep_mins,deprived,CourseLoad,Year2) If you are combining data frames which have different observations but the same columns, we can merge them using rbind(): dat1&lt;-Data[1:3,1:3] dat3&lt;-Data[6:8,1:3] res.dat2&lt;-rbind(dat1,dat3) head(res.dat2) ## Yr Sleep Sport ## 1 Second 8 Basketball ## 2 Second 7 Tennis ## 3 Second 8 Soccer ## 6 Third 7 None ## 7 Second 7 Basketball ## 8 First 7 Basketball 1.2.9 Export data frame in R to a .csv file To export a data frame to a .csv file, type: write.csv(Data, file=&quot;newdata.csv&quot;, row.names = FALSE) A file newdata.csv will be created in the working directory. Note that by default, the argument row.names is set to be TRUE. This will add a column in the dataframe which is an index number. I do not find this step useful in most analyses so I almost always set row.names to be FALSE. 1.2.10 Sort data frame by column values To sort your data frame in ascending order by Age: Data_by_age&lt;-Data[order(Data$Age),] To sort in descending order by Age: Data_by_age_des&lt;-Data[order(-Data$Age),] To sort in ascending order by Age first, then by Sleep: Data_by_age_sleep&lt;-Data[order(Data$Age, Data$Sleep),] 1.3 Data Wrangling Using dplyr Functions In the previous section, we were performing data wrangling operations using functions that are built in with base R. In this module, we will be using functions mostly from a package called dplyr, which can perform the same operations as well. Before performing data wrangling operations, let us clear our environment, so that previously declared objects are removed. This allows us to start with a clean slate, which is often desirable when starting on a new analysis. This is done via: rm(list = ls()) The dplyr package is a subset of the tidyverse package, so we can access these functions after installing and loading either package. After installing the tidyverse package, load it by typing: ##library(dplyr) or library(tidyverse) The dplyr package was developed to make the syntax more intuitive to a broader range of R users, primarily through the use of pipes. However, the code involved with functions from dlpyr tends to be longer than code involved with base R functions, and there are more functions to learn with dplyr. You will find a lot of articles on the internet by various R users about why each of them believes one approach to be superior to the other. I am not fussy about which approach you use as long as you can perform the necessary operations. It is to your benefit to be familiar with both approaches so you can work with a broader range of R users. We will continue to use the dataset ClassDataPrevious.csv as an example. Download the dataset from Canvas and read it into R: Data&lt;-read.csv(&quot;ClassDataPrevious.csv&quot;, header=TRUE) In the examples below, we are performing the same operations as in the previous section, but using dplyr functions instead of base R functions. 1.3.1 Select specific column(s) of a data frame The select() function is used to select specific columns. There are a couple of ways to use this function. First: select(Data,Year) to select the column Year from the data frame called Data. 1.3.1.1 Pipes Alternatively, we can use pipes: Data%&gt;% select(Year) Pipes in R are typed using %&gt;% or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + M on your keyboard. To think of the operations above, we can read the code as take the data frame called Data and then select the column named Year. We can interpret a pipe as “and then”. Commands after a pipe should be placed on a new line (press enter). Pipes are especially useful if we want to execute several commands in sequence, which we will see in later examples. 1.3.2 Select observations by condition(s) The filter() function allows us to subset our data based on some conditions, for example, to select students whose favorite sport is soccer: filter(Data, Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot;) We can create a new data frame called SoccerPeeps that contains students whose favorite sport is soccer: SoccerPeeps&lt;-Data%&gt;% filter(Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot;) Suppose we want to have a data frame, called SoccerPeeps_2nd, that satisfies two conditions: that the favorite sport is soccer and they are 2nd years at UVa: SoccerPeeps_2nd&lt;-Data%&gt;% filter(Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot; &amp; Year==&quot;Second&quot;) We can also set conditions based on numeric variables, for example, we want the students who sleep more than eight hours a night: Sleepy&lt;-Data%&gt;% filter(Sleep&gt;8) We can also create a data frame that contains observations as long as they satisfy at least one out of two conditions: the favorite sport is soccer or they sleep more than 8 hours a night: Sleepy_or_Soccer&lt;-Data%&gt;% filter(Sport==&quot;Soccer&quot; | Sleep&gt;8) 1.3.3 Change column name(s) It is straightforward to change the names of columns using the rename() function. For example: Data&lt;-Data%&gt;% rename(Yr=Year, Comp=Computer) allows us to change the name of two columns: from Year and Computer to Yr and Comp. 1.3.4 Summarizing variable(s) The summarize() function allows us to summarize a column. Suppose we want to find the mean value of the numeric columns: Sleep, Courses, Age, and Lunch: Data%&gt;% summarize(mean(Sleep,na.rm = T),mean(Courses),mean(Age),mean(Lunch,na.rm = T)) ## mean(Sleep, na.rm = T) mean(Courses) mean(Age) mean(Lunch, na.rm = T) ## 1 155.5593 5.016779 19.57383 156.5942 The output looks a bit cumbersome. We can give names to each summary Data%&gt;% summarize(avgSleep=mean(Sleep,na.rm = T),avgCourse=mean(Courses),avgAge=mean(Age), avgLun=mean(Lunch,na.rm = T)) ## avgSleep avgCourse avgAge avgLun ## 1 155.5593 5.016779 19.57383 156.5942 As mentioned previously, the means look suspiciously high for a couple of variables, so looking at the medians may be more informative: Data%&gt;% summarize(medSleep=median(Sleep,na.rm = T),medCourse=median(Courses), medAge=median(Age),medLun=median(Lunch,na.rm = T)) ## medSleep medCourse medAge medLun ## 1 7.5 5 19 9 Note: For a lot of functions in the dplyr package, using American spelling or British spelling works. So we can use summarise() instead of summarize(). 1.3.5 Summarizing variable by groups Suppose we want to find the median amount of sleep 1st years, 2nd years, 3rd years, and 4th years get. We can use the group_by() function: Data%&gt;% group_by(Yr)%&gt;% summarize(medSleep=median(Sleep,na.rm=T)) ## # A tibble: 4 × 2 ## Yr medSleep ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 First 8 ## 2 Fourth 7 ## 3 Second 7.5 ## 4 Third 7 The way to read the code above is Get the data frame called Data, and then group the observations by Yr, and then find the median amount of sleep by each Yr and store the median in a vector called medSleep. As seen previously, the ordering of the factor levels is in alphabetical order. For our context, it is better to rearrange the levels to First, Second, Third, Fourth. We can use the mutate() function whenever we want to transform or create a new variable. In this case, we are transforming the variable Yr by reordering the factor levels with the fct_relevel() function: Data&lt;- Data%&gt;% mutate(Yr = Yr%&gt;% fct_relevel(c(&quot;First&quot;,&quot;Second&quot;,&quot;Third&quot;,&quot;Fourth&quot;))) Get the data frame called Data, and then transform the variable called Yr, and then reorder the factor levels. Then, we use pipes, the group_by(), and summarize() functions like before: Data%&gt;% group_by(Yr)%&gt;% summarize(medSleep=median(Sleep,na.rm=T)) ## # A tibble: 4 × 2 ## Yr medSleep ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 First 8 ## 2 Second 7.5 ## 3 Third 7 ## 4 Fourth 7 This output makes a lot more sense for this context. To summarize a variable on groups formed by more than one variable, we just add the other variables in the group_by() function: Data%&gt;% group_by(Yr,Comp)%&gt;% summarize(medSleep=median(Sleep,na.rm=T)) ## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;Yr&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` ## argument. ## # A tibble: 9 × 3 ## # Groups: Yr [4] ## Yr Comp medSleep ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 First &quot;Mac&quot; 8 ## 2 First &quot;PC&quot; 7.5 ## 3 Second &quot;&quot; 7 ## 4 Second &quot;Mac&quot; 7.5 ## 5 Second &quot;PC&quot; 7.5 ## 6 Third &quot;Mac&quot; 7.5 ## 7 Third &quot;PC&quot; 7 ## 8 Fourth &quot;Mac&quot; 7 ## 9 Fourth &quot;PC&quot; 7.25 1.3.6 Create a new variable based on existing variable(s) As mentioned in the previously, the mutate() function is used to transform a variable or to create a new variable. There are a few variations of this task, based on the type of variable you want to create, and the type of variable it is based on. 1.3.6.1 Create a numeric variable based on another numeric variable The variable Sleep is in number of hours. Suppose we need to convert the values of Sleep to number of minutes, we can simply perform the following mathematical operation: Data&lt;-Data%&gt;% mutate(Sleep_mins = Sleep*60) and store the transformed variable called Sleep_mins and add Sleep_mins to the data frame called Data. 1.3.6.2 Create a binary variable based on a numeric variable Suppose we want to create a binary variable , called deprived. An observation will obtain a value of yes if they sleep for less than 7 hours a night, and no otherwise. We will then add this variable deprived to the data frame called Data: Data&lt;-Data%&gt;% mutate(deprived=ifelse(Sleep&lt;7, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;)) 1.3.6.3 Create a categorical variable based on a numeric variable Suppose we want to create a categorical variable based on the number of courses a student takes. We will call this new variable CourseLoad, which takes on the following values: light if 3 courses or less, regular if 4 or 5 courses, heavy if more than 5 courses and then add CourseLoad to the data frame Data. We can use the case_when() function from the dplyr package, instead of the cut() function: Data&lt;-Data%&gt;% mutate(CourseLoad=case_when(Courses &lt;= 3 ~ &quot;light&quot;, Courses &gt;3 &amp; Courses &lt;=5 ~ &quot;regular&quot;, Courses &gt; 5 ~ &quot;heavy&quot;)) Notice how the names of the categorical variable are supplied after a specific condition is specified. 1.3.6.4 Collapsing levels Sometimes, a categorical variable has more levels than we need for our analysis, and we want to collapse some levels. For example, the variable Yr has four levels: First, Second, Third, and Fourth. Perhaps we are more interested in comparing between upperclassmen and underclassmen, so we want to collapse First and Second Yrs into underclassmen, and Third and Fourth Yrs into upperclassmen. We will use the fct_collapse() function: Data&lt;-Data%&gt;% mutate(UpUnder=fct_collapse(Yr,under=c(&quot;First&quot;,&quot;Second&quot;),up=c(&quot;Third&quot;,&quot;Fourth&quot;))) We are creating a new variable called UpUnder, which is done by collapsing First and Second into a new factor called under, and collapsing Third and Fourth into a new factor called up. UpUnder is also added to the data frame Data. 1.3.7 Combine data frames To combine data frames which have different observations but the same columns, we can combine them using bind_rows(): dat1&lt;-Data[1:3,1:3] dat3&lt;-Data[6:8,1:3] res.dat2&lt;-bind_rows(dat1,dat3) head(res.dat2) ## Yr Sleep Sport ## 1 Second 8 Basketball ## 2 Second 7 Tennis ## 3 Second 8 Soccer ## 4 Third 7 None ## 5 Second 7 Basketball ## 6 First 7 Basketball bind_rows() works the same way as rbind(). Likewise, we can use bind_cols() instead of cbind(). 1.3.8 Sort data frame by column values To sort your data frame in ascending order by Age: Data_by_age&lt;-Data%&gt;% arrange(Age) To sort in descending order by Age: Data_by_age_des&lt;-Data%&gt;% arrange(desc(Age)) To sort in ascending order by Age first, then by Sleep: Data_by_age_sleep&lt;-Data%&gt;% arrange(Age,Sleep) "],["viz.html", "Chapter 2 Data Visualization with R Using ggplot2 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Visualizations with a Single Categorical Variable 2.3 Visualizations with a Single Quantitative Variable 2.4 Bivariate Visualizations 2.5 Multivariate Visualizations", " Chapter 2 Data Visualization with R Using ggplot2 2.1 Introduction Data visualizations are tools that summarize data. Consider the visuals from the CDC covid tracker dashboard to an external site. Without actually having access to the actual data, we have a sense of trends associated with hospitalizations and deaths. Good visualizations are easy to interpret for a wide variety of audiences, and are easier to explain than statistical models. In this module, you will learn how to create common data visualizations. The choice of data visualization is almost always determined by whether the variable(s) involved is categorical or quantitative. Discrete variables are interesting because depending on the circumstance, they can be viewed as either categorical or quantitative in the context of data visualizations. We will be using functions from the ggplot2 package to create visualizations. The ggplot2 package enables users to create various kinds of data visualizations, beyond the visualizations that can be made in base R. The ggplot2 package is automatically loaded when we load the tidyverse package, although we can load ggplot2 on its own. library(tidyverse) We will use the dataset ClassDataPrevious.csv as an example. The data were collected from an introductory statistics class at UVa from a previous semester. Download the dataset from Canvas and read it into R. Data&lt;-read.csv(&quot;ClassDataPrevious.csv&quot;, header=TRUE) The variables are: Year: the year the student is in Sleep: how much sleep the student averages a night (in hours) Sport: the student’s favorite sport Courses: how many courses the student is taking in the semester Major: the student’s major Age: the student’s age (in years) Computer: the operating system the student uses (Mac or PC) Lunch: how much the student usually spends on lunch (in dollars) 2.2 Visualizations with a Single Categorical Variable 2.2.1 Frequency tables Frequency tables are a common tool to summarize categorical variables. These tables give us the number of observations (sometimes called counts) that belong to each class of a categorical variable. These tables are created using the table() function. Suppose we want to see the number of students in each year in our data: table(Data$Year) ## ## First Fourth Second Third ## 83 30 139 46 Notice the order of the years could be rearranged to make more sense: Data$Year&lt;-factor(Data$Year, levels=c(&quot;First&quot;,&quot;Second&quot;,&quot;Third&quot;,&quot;Fourth&quot;)) levels(Data$Year) ## [1] &quot;First&quot; &quot;Second&quot; &quot;Third&quot; &quot;Fourth&quot; mytab&lt;-table(Data$Year) mytab ## ## First Second Third Fourth ## 83 139 46 30 So we have 83 first years, 139 second years, 46 third years, and 30 fourth years in our dataset. We can report these numbers using proportions instead of counts, using prop.table(): prop.table(mytab) ## ## First Second Third Fourth ## 0.2785235 0.4664430 0.1543624 0.1006711 or percentages by multiplying by 100: prop.table(mytab) * 100 ## ## First Second Third Fourth ## 27.85235 46.64430 15.43624 10.06711 To round the percentages to two decimal places, use the round() function: round(prop.table(mytab) * 100, 2) ## ## First Second Third Fourth ## 27.85 46.64 15.44 10.07 So about 27.85% of these students are first years, 46.64% are second years, 15.44% are third years, and 10.07% are fourth years. 2.2.2 Bar charts Bar charts are a simple way to visualize categorical data, and can be viewed as a visual representation of frequency tables. To create a bar chart for the years of these students, we use: ggplot(Data, aes(x=Year))+ geom_bar() We can read the number of students who are first, second, third, and fourth years by reading off the corresponding value on the vertical axis. From these two lines we code, we can see the basic structure of creating data visualizations with the ggplot() function: Use the ggplot() function, and supply the name of the data frame, and the x- and/or y- variables via the aes() function. End this line with a + operator, and then press enter. In the next line, specify the type of graph we want to create (called geoms). For a bar chart, type geom_bar(). Some describe these lines of code as two layers of code. These two layers must be supplied for all data visualizations with ggplot(). Additional optional layers can be added (these usually deal with the details of the visuals). Suppose we want to change the orientation of this bar chart, we can add an optional line, or layer: ggplot(Data, aes(x=Year))+ geom_bar()+ coord_flip() It is recommended that each layer is typed on a line below the previous layer. A + sign is used at the end of each layer to add another layer below. To change the color of the bars: ggplot(Data, aes(x=Year))+ geom_bar(fill=&quot;blue&quot;) To have a different color to outline the bars: ggplot(Data, aes(x=Year))+ geom_bar(fill=&quot;blue&quot;,color=&quot;orange&quot;) 2.2.2.1 Customize title and labels of axes in bar charts To change the orientation of the labels on the horizontal axis, we add an extra layer called theme. This will be useful when we have many classes and/or labels with long names. To rotate the labels on the horizontal by 90 degrees: ggplot(Data, aes(x=Year))+ geom_bar()+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) As we create more visualizations, it is good practice to give short but meaningful and descriptive names for each axis and provide a title. We can change the labels of the x- and y- axes, as well as add a title for the bar chart by adding another layer called labs: ggplot(Data, aes(x=Year))+ geom_bar()+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+ labs(x=&quot;Year&quot;, y=&quot;Number of Students&quot;, title=&quot;Dist of Years&quot;) We can also adjust the position of the title, for example, center-justify it via theme: ggplot(Data, aes(x=Year))+ geom_bar()+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ labs(x=&quot;Year&quot;, y=&quot;Number of Students&quot;, title=&quot;Dist of Years&quot;) 2.2.2.2 Create a bar chart using proportions Suppose we want to create a bar chart where the y-axis displays the proportions, rather than the counts of each level. There are a few steps to produce such a bar chart. First, we create a new dataframe, where each row represents a year, and we add the proportion of each year into a new column: newData&lt;-Data%&gt;% group_by(Year)%&gt;% summarize(Counts=n())%&gt;% mutate(Percent=Counts/nrow(Data)) The code above does the following: Creates a new data frame called newData by taking the data frame called Data, and then groups the observations by Year, and then counts the number of observations in each Year and stores these values in a vector called Counts, and then creates a new vector called Percent by using the mathematical operations as specified in mutate(). Percent is added to newData. We can take a look at the contents of newData: newData ## # A tibble: 4 × 3 ## Year Counts Percent ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 First 83 0.279 ## 2 Second 139 0.466 ## 3 Third 46 0.154 ## 4 Fourth 30 0.101 To create a bar chart using proportions: ggplot(newData, aes(x=Year, y=Percent))+ geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;)+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ labs(x=&quot;Year&quot;, y=&quot;Percent of Students&quot;, title=&quot;Dist of Years&quot;) Note the following: In the first layer, we use newData instead of the old data frame. In aes(), we specified a y-variable, which we want to be Percent. In the second layer, we specified stat=\"identity\" inside geom_bar(). 2.3 Visualizations with a Single Quantitative Variable 2.3.1 5 number summary The summary() function, when applied to a quantitative variable, produces the 5 number summary: the minimum, the first quartile (25th percentile), the median (50th percentile), the third quartile (75th percentile), and the maximum, as well as the mean. For example, to obtain the 5 number summary of the ages of these students: summary(Data$Age) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 18.00 19.00 19.00 19.57 20.00 51.00 The average age of the observations in this dataset is 19.57 years old. Notice the first quartile and the median are both 19 years old, that means at least a quarter of the observations are 19 years old. Also note the maximum of 51 years old, so we have a student who is quite a lot older than the rest. 2.3.2 Boxplots A boxplot is a graphical representation of the 5 number summary. To create a generic boxplot, we have the following two lines of code when using the ggplot() function: ggplot(Data, aes(y=Age))+ geom_boxplot() Note we are still using the same structure when creating data visualizations with ggplot(): Use the ggplot() function, and supply the name of the data frame, and the x- and/or y- variables via the aes() function. End this line with a + operator, and then press enter. In the next line, specify the type of graph we want to create (called geoms). For a boxplot, type geom_boxplot. Notice there are outliers (observations that are a lot older or younger) that are denoted by the dots. One is the 51 year old, and 22 year olds are deemed to be outliers. The rule being used is the \\(1.5 \\times IQR\\) rule. Similar to bar charts, we can change the orientation of boxplots by adding an additional layer as before: ggplot(Data, aes(y=Age))+ geom_boxplot()+ coord_flip() We can change the color of the box and the outliers similarly: ggplot(Data, aes(y=Age))+ geom_boxplot(color=&quot;blue&quot;, outlier.color = &quot;orange&quot; ) 2.3.3 Histograms A histogram displays the number of observations within each bin on the x-axis: ggplot(Data,aes(x=Age))+ geom_histogram() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. Notice a warning message is displayed when creating a basic histogram. To fix this, we use the binwidth argument within geom_histogram. We try binwidth=1 for now, which means the width of the bin is 1 unit: ggplot(Data,aes(x=Age))+ geom_histogram(binwidth = 1,fill=&quot;blue&quot;,color=&quot;orange&quot;) The ages of the students are mostly young, with 19 and 20 years olds being the most commonly occuring. A well-known drawback of histograms is that the width of the bins can drastically affect the visual. For example, suppose we change the binwidth to 2: ggplot(Data,aes(x=Age))+ geom_histogram(binwidth = 2,fill=&quot;blue&quot;,color=&quot;orange&quot;) Each bar now contains two ages: the first bar contains the 18 and 19 year olds. Notice how the shape has been changed a little bit from the previous histogram with a different binwidth? 2.3.4 Density plots Density plots are a variation of histograms, where the plot attempts to use a smooth mathematical function to approximate the shape of the histogram, and is unaffected by binwidth: ggplot(Data,aes(x=Age))+ geom_density() We can see that 19 and 20 year olds are the most common ages in this data. Be careful in interpreting the values on the veritical axis: these do not represent proportions. A characteristic of density plots is that the area under the plot is always one. 2.4 Bivariate Visualizations We will now look at visualizations we can create to explore the relationship between two variables. The term bivariate means that we are looking at two variables. We will be using a new dataset as an example, so we clear the environment: rm(list = ls()) We will be using the dataset, gapminder, from the gapminder package. Install and load the gapminder package. Also load the tidyverse package (which automatically loads the ggplot2 package): library(tidyverse) library(gapminder) We can take a look at the gapminder dataset: gapminder[1:15,] ## # A tibble: 15 × 6 ## country continent year lifeExp pop gdpPercap ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Afghanistan Asia 1952 28.8 8425333 779. ## 2 Afghanistan Asia 1957 30.3 9240934 821. ## 3 Afghanistan Asia 1962 32.0 10267083 853. ## 4 Afghanistan Asia 1967 34.0 11537966 836. ## 5 Afghanistan Asia 1972 36.1 13079460 740. ## 6 Afghanistan Asia 1977 38.4 14880372 786. ## 7 Afghanistan Asia 1982 39.9 12881816 978. ## 8 Afghanistan Asia 1987 40.8 13867957 852. ## 9 Afghanistan Asia 1992 41.7 16317921 649. ## 10 Afghanistan Asia 1997 41.8 22227415 635. ## 11 Afghanistan Asia 2002 42.1 25268405 727. ## 12 Afghanistan Asia 2007 43.8 31889923 975. ## 13 Albania Europe 1952 55.2 1282697 1601. ## 14 Albania Europe 1957 59.3 1476505 1942. ## 15 Albania Europe 1962 64.8 1728137 2313. Per the documentation, the variables are country continent year: from 1952 to 2007 in increments of 5 years lifeExp: life expectancy at birth, in years pop: population of country gdpPercap: GDP per capita in US dollars, adjusted for inflation We notice that data are collected from each country across a number of different years: 1952 to 2007 in increments of five years. For this example, we will mainly focus on the data for the most recent year, 2007: Data&lt;-gapminder%&gt;% filter(year==2007) The specific visuals to use will again depend on the type of variables we are using, whether they are categorical or quantitative. 2.4.1 Compare quantitative variable across categories 2.4.1.1 Side by side boxplots Side by side boxplots are useful to compare a quantitative variable across different classes of a categorical variable. For example, we want to compare life expectancies across the different continents in the year 2007: ggplot(Data, aes(x=continent, y=lifeExp))+ geom_boxplot(fill=&quot;Blue&quot;)+ labs(x=&quot;Continent&quot;, y=&quot;Life Exp&quot;, title=&quot;Dist of Life Expectancies by Continent&quot;) Countries in the Oceania region have long life expectancies with little variation. Comparing the Americas and Asia, the median life expectancies are similar, but the spread is larger for Asia. 2.4.1.2 Violin plots Violin plots are an alternative to boxplots. To create these plots to compare life expectancies across the different continents in the year 2007: ggplot(Data, aes(x=continent, y=lifeExp))+ geom_violin()+ labs(x=&quot;Continent&quot;, y=&quot;Life Exp&quot;, title=&quot;Dist of Life Expectancies by Continent&quot;) The width of the violin informs us which values are more commonly occuring. For example, look at the violin for Europe. The violin is wider at higher life expectancies, so longer life expectancies are more common in European countries. 2.4.2 Summarizing two categorical variables For this example, we create a new binary variable called expectancy, which will be denoted as low if the life expectancy in the country is less than 70 years, and high otherwise: Data&lt;-Data%&gt;% mutate(expectancy=ifelse(lifeExp&lt;70,&quot;Low&quot;,&quot;High&quot;)) 2.4.2.1 Two-way tables Suppose we want to see how expectancy varies across the continents. A two-way table can be created for produce counts when two categorical variables are involved: mytab2&lt;-table(Data$continent, Data$expectancy) ##continent in rows, expectancy in columns mytab2 ## ## High Low ## Africa 7 45 ## Americas 22 3 ## Asia 22 11 ## Europe 30 0 ## Oceania 2 0 The first variable in table() will be placed in the rows, the second variable will be placed in the columns. From this table, we can see that 22 countries in the Americas have high life expectancies, while 3 countries in the Americas have low life expectancies. We may be interested in looking at the proportions, instead of counts, of countries in each continent that have high or low life expectancies. To convert this table to proportions, we can use prop.table(): prop.table(mytab2, 1) ## ## High Low ## Africa 0.1346154 0.8653846 ## Americas 0.8800000 0.1200000 ## Asia 0.6666667 0.3333333 ## Europe 1.0000000 0.0000000 ## Oceania 1.0000000 0.0000000 We want proportions for each continent, so we want proportions in each row to add up to 1. Therefore, the second argument in prop.table() is 1. Enter 2 for this argument if we want the proportions in each column to add up to 1. As before, to convert to percentages and round to 2 decimal places: round(prop.table(mytab2, 1) * 100, 2) ## ## High Low ## Africa 13.46 86.54 ## Americas 88.00 12.00 ## Asia 66.67 33.33 ## Europe 100.00 0.00 ## Oceania 100.00 0.00 2.4.2.2 Bar charts A stacked bar chart can be used to display the relationship between the binary variable expectancy across continents: ggplot(Data, aes(x=continent, fill=expectancy))+ geom_bar(position = &quot;stack&quot;)+ labs(x=&quot;Continent&quot;, y=&quot;Count&quot;, title=&quot;Life Expectancies by Continent&quot;) We can see how many countries exist in each continent, and how many of these countries in each continent have high or low life expectancies. For example, there are about 25 countries in the Americas with the majority having high life expectancies. We can change the way the bar chart is displayed by changing position in geom_bar() to position = \"dodge\" or position = \"fill\", the latter being more useful for proportions instead of counts: ggplot(Data, aes(x=continent, fill=expectancy))+ geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) ggplot(Data, aes(x=continent, fill=expectancy))+ geom_bar(position = &quot;fill&quot;)+ labs(x=&quot;Continent&quot;, y=&quot;Proportion&quot;, title=&quot;Proportion of Life Expectancies by Continent&quot;) 2.4.3 Summarizing two quantitative variables 2.4.3.1 Scatterplots Scatterplots are the standard visualization when two quantitative variables are involved. To create a scatterplot for life expectancy against GDP per capita: ggplot(Data, aes(x=gdpPercap,y=lifeExp))+ geom_point() We see a curved relationship between life expectancies and GDP per capita. Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have longer life expectancies. When there are many observations, plots on the scatterplot may actually overlap each other. To have a sense of how many of these exist, we can add a transparency scale called alpha=0.2 inside geom_point(): ggplot(Data, aes(x=gdpPercap,y=lifeExp))+ geom_point(alpha=0.2)+ labs(x=&quot;GDP&quot;, y=&quot;Life Exp&quot;, title=&quot;Scatterplot of Life Exp against GDP&quot;) The default value for alpha is 1, which means the points are not at all transparent. The closer this value is to 0, the more transparent the points are. A darker point indicates more observations with those specific values on both variables. 2.5 Multivariate Visualizations We will now look at visualizations we can create to explore the relationship between multiple (more than two) variables. The term multivariate means that we are looking at more than two variables. 2.5.1 Bar charts Previously, we created a bar chart to look at how expectancy varies across the continents. Suppose we want to see how these bar graphs vary across the years, so we use the year variable as a third variable via a layer facet_wrap: ##another data frame across all years plus a binary variable ##for expectancy Data.all&lt;-gapminder%&gt;% mutate(expectancy=ifelse(lifeExp&lt;70,&quot;Low&quot;,&quot;High&quot;)) ggplot(Data.all,aes(x=continent, fill=expectancy))+ geom_bar(position = &quot;fill&quot;)+ facet_wrap(~year) Notice that three categorical variables are summarized in this bar chart. Is there something that can be done to improve this bar chart? How would you make this improvement? 2.5.2 Scatterplots Previously, we created a scatterplot of life expectancy against GDP per capita. We can include another quantitative variable in the scatterplot, by using the size of the plots. We can use the size of the plots to denote the population of the countries. This is supplied via size in aes(): ggplot(Data, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, size=pop))+ geom_point() We can adjust the size of the plots by adding a layer scale_size(): ggplot(Data, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, size=pop))+ geom_point()+ scale_size(range = c(0.1,12)) This scatterplot summarizes three quantitative variables. We can use different-colored plots to denote which continent each point belongs to: ggplot(Data, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, size=pop, color=continent))+ geom_point()+ scale_size(range = c(0.1,12)) This scatterplot summarizes three quantitative variables and one categorical variable. We can adjust the plots by changing its shape and making it more translucent via shape and alpha in aes(): ggplot(Data, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, size=pop, fill=continent))+ geom_point(shape=21, alpha=0.5)+ scale_size(range = c(0.1,12))+ labs(x=&quot;GDP&quot;, y=&quot;Life Exp&quot;, title=&quot;Scatterplot of Life Exp against GDP&quot;) "],["slr.html", "Chapter 3 Basics with Simple Linear Regression (SLR) 3.1 Introduction 3.2 Simple Linear Regression (SLR) 3.3 Estimating Regression Coefficients in SLR 3.4 Estimating Variance of Errors in SLR 3.5 Assessing Linear Association 3.6 A Word of Caution 3.7 R Tutorial", " Chapter 3 Basics with Simple Linear Regression (SLR) 3.1 Introduction We will start this module by introducing the simple linear regression model. Simple linear regression uses the term “simple,” because it concerns the study of only one predictor variable with one quantitative response variable. In contrast, multiple linear regression, which we will study in future modules, uses the term “multiple,” because it concerns the study of two or more predictor variables with one quantitative response variable. We start with simple linear regression as it is much easier to visualize concepts in regression models when there is only one predictor variable. For the time being, we will only consider predictor variables that are quantitative. We will consider predictor variables that are categorical in future modules. The most common way of visualizing the relationship between one quantitative predictor variable and one quantitative response variable is with a scatter plot. In the simulated example below, we have data from 6000 UVa undergraduate students on the amount of time they spend studying in a week (in minutes), and how many courses they are taking in the semester (3 or 4 credit courses). ##create dataframe df&lt;-data.frame(study,courses) ##fit regression result&lt;-lm(study~courses, data=df) ##create scatterplot with regression line overlaid plot(df$courses, df$study, xlab=&quot;# of Courses&quot;, ylab=&quot;Study Time (Mins)&quot;) abline(result) Figure 3.1: Scatterplot of Study Time against Number of Courses Taken Questions that we may have include: Are study time and the number of courses taken related to one another? How strong is this relationship? Could we use the data to make a prediction for the study time of a student who is not in this scatterplot? How confident are we of the prediction? These questions can be answered using simple linear regression. Note that we will only be learning about models with just one response variable. We will not cover multivariate regression, which is used when there is more than one response variable. There may be some confusion between “multiple” linear regression and “multivariate” regression due to the closeness in terminology. 3.1.1 Basic Ideas with Statistics 3.1.1.1 Population vs Sample Statistical methods are usually used to make inferences about the population based on information from a sample. A sample is the collection of units that is actually measured or surveyed in a study. The population includes all units of interest. In the study time example above, the population is all UVa undergraduate students, while the sample is the 6000 students that we have data on and are displayed on the scatterplot. 3.1.1.2 Parameters vs Statistics Parameters are numerical quantities that describe a population. Statistics are numerical quantities that describe a sample. In the study time example, an example of a parameter will be the average study time among all UVa undergraduate students (called the population mean), and an example of a statistic will be the average study time among the 6000 UVa students we have data on (called the sample mean). Notice that in real life, we will rarely know the actual numerical value of a parameter. So we use the numerical value of the statistic to estimate the unknown numerical value of the corresponding parameter. We also have different notation for parameters and statistics. For example, the population mean is denoted as \\(\\mu\\). the sample mean is denoted as \\(\\bar{x}\\). We say that \\(\\bar{x}\\) is an estimator of \\(\\mu\\). It is important to pay attention to whether we are describing a statistic (a known value that can be calculated) or a parameter (an unknown value). 3.1.2 Motivation Linear regression models generally have two primary uses: Prediction: Predict a future value of a response variable, using information from predictor variables. Association: Quantify the relationship between variables. How does a change in the predictor variable change the value of the response variable? We always distinguish between a response variable, denoted by \\(y\\), and a predictor variable, denoted by \\(x\\). In most statistical models, we say that the response variable can be approximated by some mathematical function, denoted by \\(f\\), of the predictor variable, i.e. \\[ y \\approx f(x). \\] Oftentimes, we write this relationship as \\[ y = f(x) + \\epsilon, \\] where \\(\\epsilon\\) denotes a random error term, with a mean of 0. The error term cannot be predicted based on the data we have. There are various statistical methods to estimate \\(f\\). Once we estimate \\(f\\), we can use our method for prediction and / or association. Using the study time example above: a prediction example: a student intends to take 4 courses in the semester. What is this student’s predicted study time, on average? an association example: we want to see how taking more courses increases study time. 3.1.2.1 Practice questions In the examples below, are we using a regression model for prediction or for association? It is early in the morning and I am heading out for the rest of the day. I want to know the weather forecast for the rest of the day so I know what to wear. An executive for a sports league wants to assess how increasing the length of commercial breaks may impact the enjoyment of sports fans who watch games on TV. The Education Secretary would like to evaluate how certain factors such as use of technology in classrooms and investment in teacher training and teacher pay are associated with reading skills of students. When buying a home, the prospective buyer would like to know if the home is under- or over- priced, given its characteristics. 3.2 Simple Linear Regression (SLR) In simple linear regression (SLR), the function \\(f\\) that relates the predictor variable with the response variable is typically \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\). Mathematically, we express this as \\[ y \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x, \\] or in other words, that the response variable has an approximately linear relationship with the predictor variable. In SLR, this relationship is more explicitly formulated as the simple linear regression equation: \\[\\begin{equation} E(y|x)=\\beta_0+\\beta_{1}x. \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are parameters in the SLR equation, and we want to estimate them. These parameters are sometimes called regression coefficients. \\(\\beta_1\\) is also called the slope. It denotes the change in \\(y\\), on average, when \\(x\\) increases by one unit. \\(\\beta_0\\) is also called the intercept. It denotes the average of \\(y\\) when \\(x=0\\). The notation on the left hand side of (3.1) denotes the expected value of the response variable, for a fixed value of the predictor variable. What (3.1) implies is that, for each value of the predictor variable \\(x\\), the expected value of the response variable \\(y\\) is \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_{1}x\\). The expected value is also the population mean. Applying (3.1) to our study time example, it implies that: for students who take 3 courses, their expected study time is equal to \\(\\beta_0 + 3\\beta_1\\), for students who take 4 courses, their expected study time is equal to \\(\\beta_0 + 4\\beta_1\\), for students who take 5 courses, their expected study time is equal to \\(\\beta_0 + 5\\beta_1\\). So \\(f(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x\\) gives us the value of the expected value of the response variable for a specific value of the predictor variable. But, for each value of the predictor variable, the value of the response variable is not a constant. We say that for each value of \\(x\\), the response variable \\(y\\) has some variance. The variance of the response variable for each value of \\(x\\) is the same as the variance of the error term, \\(\\epsilon\\). Thus we have the simple linear regression model \\[\\begin{equation} y=\\beta_0+\\beta_{1} x + \\epsilon. \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] We need to make some assumptions for the error term \\(\\epsilon\\). Generally, the assumptions are: The errors have mean 0. The errors have variance denoted by \\(\\sigma^2\\). Notice this variance is constant. The errors are independent. The errors are normally distributed. From (3.2), notice we have another parameter, \\(\\sigma^2\\). We will go into more detail about what these assumptions mean, and how to assess whether they are met, in module 5. What these assumptions mean is that for each value of the predictor variable \\(x\\), the response variable: follows a normal distribution, with mean equal to \\(\\beta_0+\\beta_{1} x\\), and variance equal to \\(\\sigma^2\\). Using our study time example, it means that: for students who take 3 courses, the distribution of their study times is \\(N(\\beta_0 + 3\\beta_1, \\sigma^2)\\). for students who take 4 courses, the distribution of their study times is \\(N(\\beta_0 + 4\\beta_1, \\sigma^2)\\). for students who take 5 courses, the distribution of their study times is \\(N(\\beta_0 + 5\\beta_1, \\sigma^2)\\). So if we were to subset our dataframe into three subsets, one with students who take 3 courses, another subset for students who take 4 courses, and another subset for students who take 5 courses, and then create a density plot of study times for each subset, each density plot should follow a normal distribution, with different means, and the same spread. Let us take a look at these density plots next. library(tidyverse) ##subset dataframe x.3&lt;-df[which(df$courses==3),] ##density plot of study time for students taking 3 courses ggplot(x.3,aes(x=study))+ geom_density()+ labs(x=&quot;Study Time (Mins)&quot;, title=&quot;Dist of Study Times with 3 Courses&quot;) ##subset dataframe x.4&lt;-df[which(df$courses==4),] ##density plot of study time for students taking 4 courses ggplot(x.4,aes(x=study))+ geom_density()+ labs(x=&quot;Study Time (Mins)&quot;, title=&quot;Dist of Study Times with 4 Courses&quot;) ##subset dataframe x.5&lt;-df[which(df$courses==5),] ##density plot of study time for students taking 5 courses ggplot(x.5,aes(x=study))+ geom_density()+ labs(x=&quot;Study Time (Mins)&quot;, title=&quot;Dist of Study Times with 5 Courses&quot;) Notice all of these plots are normal, with different means (centers), and similar spreads. Please see the associated video for more explanation about the distribution of the response variable, for each value of the predictor variable, in an SLR setting. 3.3 Estimating Regression Coefficients in SLR From (3.1) and (3.2), we noted that we have to estimate the regression coefficients \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1\\) as well as the parameter \\(\\sigma^2\\) associated with the error term. As mentioned earlier, we are unable to obtain numerical values of these parameters as we do not have data from the entire population. So what we do is use the data from our sample to estimate these parameters. We estimate \\(\\beta_0,\\beta_1\\) using \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0,\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) based on a sample of observations \\((x_i,y_i)\\) of size \\(n\\). The subscripts associated with the response and predictor variables denote which data point that value belongs to. Let us take a look at the first few rows of the data frame for the study time example: head(df) ## study courses ## 1 429.8311 3 ## 2 458.4588 3 ## 3 391.9406 3 ## 4 378.0196 3 ## 5 397.9856 3 ## 6 405.7145 3 For example, \\(x_1\\) denotes the number of courses taken by student number 1 in the dataframe, which is 3. \\(y_4\\) denotes the study time for student number 4 in the dataframe, which is 378.0196456. Following (3.1) and (3.2), the sample versions are \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{y}=\\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\beta}_1 x \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation} y=\\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\beta}_1 x + e \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] respectively. (3.3) is called the estimated SLR equation, or fitted SLR equation. (3.4) is called the estimated SLR model. \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1,\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) are the estimators for \\(\\beta_1,\\beta_0\\) respectively. These estimators can be interpreted in the following manner: \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) denotes the change in the predicted \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) increases by 1 unit. Alternatively, it denotes the change in \\(y\\), on average, when \\(x\\) increases by 1 unit. \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) denotes the predicted \\(y\\) when \\(x=0\\). Alternatively, it denotes the average of \\(y\\) when \\(x=0\\). From (3.4), notice we use \\(e\\) to denote the residual, or in other words, the “error” in the sample. From (3.3) and (3.4), we have the following quantities that we can compute: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Predicted/Fitted values: } \\hat{y}_i = \\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i. \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Residuals: } e_i = y_i-\\hat{y}_i. \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Sum of Squared Residuals: } SS_{res} = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2. \\tag{3.7} \\end{equation}\\] We compute the estimated coefficients \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1,\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) using the method of least squares, i.e. choose the numerical values of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1,\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) that minimize \\(SS_{res}\\) as given in (3.7). By minimizing \\(SS_{res}\\) with respect to \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\), the estimated coefficients in the simple linear regression equation are \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\bar{x})^2} \\tag{3.8} \\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{y}- \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{x} \\tag{3.9} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1, \\hat{\\beta}_0\\) are called least squares estimators. The minimization of \\(SS_{res}\\) with respect to \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) is done by taking the partial derivatives of (3.7) with respect to \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\), setting these two partial derivatives equal to 0, and solving these two equations for \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\). Let’s take a look at the estimated coefficients for our study time example: ##fit regression result&lt;-lm(study~courses, data=df) ##print out the estimated coefficients result ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = study ~ courses, data = df) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) courses ## 58.45 120.39 From our sample of 6000 students, we have \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) = 120.3930985. The predicted study time increases by 120.3930985 minutes for each additional course taken. \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0\\) = 58.4482853. The predicted study time is 58.4482853 when no courses are taken. Notice this value does not make sense, as a student cannot be taking 0 courses. If you look at our data, the number of courses taken is 3, 4, or 5. So we should only use our regression when \\(3 \\leq x \\leq 5\\). We cannot use it for values of \\(x\\) outside the range of our data. Making predictions of the response variable for predictors outside the range of the data is called extrapolation and should not be done. 3.4 Estimating Variance of Errors in SLR The estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\), the variance of the error terms (also the variance of the probability distribution of \\(y\\) given \\(x\\)) is \\[\\begin{equation} s^2 = MS_{res} = \\frac{SS_{res}}{n-2} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n e_i^2}{n-2}, \\tag{3.10} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(MS_{res}\\) is the called the mean squared residuals. \\(\\sigma^2\\), the variance of the error terms, measures the spread of the response variable, for each value of \\(x\\). The smaller this is, the closer the data points are to the regression equation. 3.4.1 Practice questions Take a look at the scatterplot of study time against number of courses taken, Figure 3.1. On this plot, label the following: estimated SLR equation the fitted value when \\(x=3\\), \\(x=4\\), and \\(x=5\\). the residual for any data point on the plot of your choosing. Try these on your own first, then view the associated video to see if you labeled the plot correctly! 3.5 Assessing Linear Association As noted earlier, the variance of the error terms inform us how close the data points are to the estimated SLR equation. The smaller the variance of the error terms, the closer the data points are to the estimated SLR equation. This in turn implies the linear relationship between the variables is stronger. We will learn about some common measures that are used to quantify the strength of the linear relationship between the response and predictor variables. Before we do that, we need to define some other terms. 3.5.1 Sum of squares \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Total Sum of Squares: } SS_T = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^{2}. \\tag{3.11} \\end{equation}\\] Total sum of squares is defined as the total variance in the response variable. The larger this value is, the larger the spread is of the response variable. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Regression sum of squares: } SS_R = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat{y_i} - \\bar{y})^{2}. \\tag{3.12} \\end{equation}\\] Regression sum of squares is defined as the variance in the response variable that can be explained by our regression. We also have residual sum of squares, \\(SS_{res}\\). Its mathematical formulation is given in (3.7). It is defined as the variance in the response variable that cannot be explained by our regression. It can be shown that \\[\\begin{equation} SS_T = SS_R + SS_{res}. \\tag{3.13} \\end{equation}\\] Each of the sums of squares has its associated degrees of freedom (df): df for \\(SS_R\\): \\(df_R = 1\\) df for \\(SS_{res}\\): \\(df_{res} = n-2\\) df for \\(SS_T\\): \\(df_T = n-1\\) Please see the associated video for more explanation about the concept behind degrees of freedom. 3.5.2 ANOVA Table Information regarding the sums of squares is usually presented in the form of an ANOVA (analysis of variance) table: Note: Dividing each sum of square with its corresponding degrees of freedom gives the corresponding mean square. In the last column, we report an \\(F\\) statistic, which equal to \\(\\frac{MS_R}{MS_{res}}\\). This \\(F\\) statistic is associated with an ANOVA F test, which we will look at in more detail in the next subsection. To obtain the ANOVA table for our study time example: anova(result) ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: study ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## courses 1 57977993 57977993 65404 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** ## Residuals 5998 5317017 886 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Notice that R does not print out the information for the line regarding \\(SS_T\\). 3.5.3 ANOVA \\(F\\) Test In SLR, the ANOVA \\(F\\) statistic from the ANOVA table can be used to test if the slope of the SLR equation is 0 or not. In words, this means that whether there is a linear association between the variables or not. If the slope is 0, it means that changes in the value of the predictor variable do not change the value of the response variable, on average; hence the variables are not linearly associated. The null and alternative hypotheses are: \\[ H_0: \\beta_1 = 0, H_a: \\beta_1 \\neq 0. \\] The test statistic is \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:ANOVA} F = \\frac{MS_R}{MS_{res}} \\end{equation}\\] and is compared with an \\(F_{1,n-2}\\) distribution. Note that \\(F_{1,n-2}\\) is read as an F distribution with 1 and \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom. Going back to the study time example, the \\(F\\) statistic is 6.5403586^{4}. The critical value can be found using qf(1-0.05, 1, 6000-2) ## [1] 3.84301 Since our test statistic is larger than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis. Our data support the claim that the slope is different from 0, or in other words, that there is a linear association between study time and number of courses taken. 3.5.4 Coefficient of determination The coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), is \\[\\begin{equation} R^{2} = \\frac{SS_R}{SS_T} = 1 - \\frac{SS_{res}}{SS_T}. \\tag{3.14} \\end{equation}\\] \\(R^{2}\\) is an indication of how well the data fits our model. In the context of simple linear regression, it denotes the proportion of variance in the response variable that is explained by the predictor. A few notes about \\(R^2\\): \\(0 \\leq R^2 \\leq 1\\). Values closer to 1 indicate a better fit; values closer to 0 indicate a poorer fit. Sometimes reported as a percentage. To obtain \\(R^2\\) for our study time example: anova.tab&lt;-anova(result) ##SST not provided, so we add up SSR and SSres SST&lt;-sum(anova.tab$&quot;Sum Sq&quot;) ##R2 anova.tab$&quot;Sum Sq&quot;[1]/SST ## [1] 0.9159963 This implies that the proportion of variance in study time that can be explained by the number of courses taken is 0.9159963. 3.5.5 Correlation A measure used to quantify the strength of the linear association between two quantitative variables is the sample correlation. The sample correlation, \\(\\mbox{Corr}(x,y)\\) or \\(r\\), is given by \\[\\begin{equation} r = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^{2}(y_i - \\bar{y})^{2}}}. \\tag{3.15} \\end{equation}\\] A few notes about \\(r\\): \\(-1 \\leq r \\leq 1\\). Sign of correlation indicates direction of association. A positive value indicates a positive linear association: as the predictor variable increases, so does the response variable, on average. A negative value indicates a negative linear association: as the predictor variable increases, the response variable decreases, on average. Values closer to 1 or -1 indicate a stronger linear association; values closer to 0 indicate a weaker linear association. In SLR, it turns out that \\(r^2 = R^2\\). Using our study time example, the correlation between study time and number of courses taken is cor(df$study, df$courses) ## [1] 0.9570769 This value indicates a very strong and positive linear association between study time and number of courses taken (remember that this is simulated data and is not real). 3.5.5.1 How strong is strong? A question that is often raised is how large should the magnitude of the sample correlation be for it to be considered strong? The answer is: it depends on the context. If you are conducting an experiment that is governed by scientific laws (e.g an experiment verifying Newton’s 2nd law that \\(F = ma\\)), we should expect an extremely high correlation. A correlation of 0.9 in such an instance may be considered weak. The value of the correlation you have should be compared with correlations from similar studies in that domain to determine if it is strong or not. 3.6 A Word of Caution To be able to use the measures we have learned (such as correlation, \\(R^2\\)) and to interpret the estimated regression coefficients, we must verify via a scatterplot that the association between the two variables is approximately linear. If we see a non linear pattern in the scatterplot, we should not use or interpret these values. We will learn how to remedy the situation if we see a non linear pattern in the scatterplot in module 5. Please see the associated video for a demonstration on how not looking at the scatterplot can lead to misleading interpretations. 3.7 R Tutorial For this tutorial, we will work with the dataset elmhurst from the openintro package in R. library(tidyverse) library(openintro) Data&lt;-openintro::elmhurst Type ?openintro::elmhurst to read the documentation for datasets in R. Always seek to understand the background of your data! The key pieces of information are: A random sample of 50 students (all freshman from the 2011 class at Elmhurst College). Family income of the student (units are missing). Gift aid, in $1000s. We want to explore how family income may be related to gift aid, in a simple linear regression framework. Visualization We should always verify with scatterplot that the relationship is (approximately) linear before proceeding with correlation and simple linear regression! ##scatterplot of gift aid against family income ggplot2::ggplot(Data, aes(x=family_income,y=gift_aid))+ geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;, se=FALSE)+ labs(x=&quot;Family Income&quot;, y=&quot;Gift Aid&quot;, title=&quot;Scatterplot of Gift Aid against Family&quot;) We note that the observations are fairly evenly scattered on both sides of the regression line, so a linear association exists. We see a negative linear association. As family income increases, the gift aid, on average, decreases. We also do not see any observation with weird values that may warrant further investigation. Regression We use the lm() function to fit a regression model: ##regress gift aid against family income result&lt;-lm(gift_aid~family_income, data=Data) Use the summary() function to display relevant information from this regression: ##look at information regarding regression summary(result) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = gift_aid ~ family_income, data = Data) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -10.1128 -3.6234 -0.2161 3.1587 11.5707 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The estimated slope informs us the the predicted gift aid decreases by 0.0430717 thousands of dollars (or $43.07) per unit increase in family income. \\(\\hat{\\beta}_0 =\\) 24.319329. For students with no family income, their predicted gift aid is $24 319.33. Note: from the scatterplot, we have an observation with 0 family income. We must be careful in not extrapolating when making predictions with our regression. We should only make predictions for family incomes between the minimum and maximum values of family incomes in our data. \\(s\\) = 4.7825989, is the estimate of the standard deviation of the error terms. This is reported as residual standard error in R. Squaring this gives the estimated variance. \\(F\\) = 15.8772043. This is the value of the ANOVA \\(F\\) statistic. The corresponding p-value is reported. Since this p-value is very small, we reject the null hypothesis. The data support the claim that there is a linear association between gift aid and family income. \\(R^2 =\\) 0.2485582. The coefficient of determination informs us that about 24.86% of the variation in gift aid can be explained by family income. Extract values from R objects We can actually extract these values that are being reported from summary(result). To see what can be extracted from an R object, use the names() function: ##see what can be extracted from summary(result) names(summary(result)) ## [1] &quot;call&quot; &quot;terms&quot; &quot;residuals&quot; &quot;coefficients&quot; ## [5] &quot;aliased&quot; &quot;sigma&quot; &quot;df&quot; &quot;r.squared&quot; ## [9] &quot;adj.r.squared&quot; &quot;fstatistic&quot; &quot;cov.unscaled&quot; To extract the estimated coefficients: ##extract coefficients summary(result)$coefficients ## Estimate Std.

To extract a specific value, we can specify the row and column indices: ##extract slope summary(result)$coefficients[2,1] ## [1] -0.04307165 ##extract intercept summary(result)$coefficients[1,1] ## [1] 24.31933 On your own, extract the values of the residual standard error, the ANOVA F statistic, and \\(R^2\\). Prediction A use of regression models is prediction. Suppose I want to predict the gift aid of a student with family income of 50 thousand dollars (assuming the unit is in thousands of dollars). We use the predict() function: ##create data point for prediction newdata&lt;-data.frame(family_income=50) ##predicted gift aid when x=50 predict(result,newdata) ## 1 ## 22.16575 This student’s predicted gift aid is $22 165.75. Alternatively, you could have calculated this by plugging \\(x=50\\) into the estimated SLR equation: summary(result)$coefficients[1,1] + summary(result)$coefficients[2,1]*50 ## [1] 22.16575 ANOVA table We use the anova() function to display the ANOVA table anova.tab&lt;-anova(result) anova.tab ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: gift_aid ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## family_income 1 363.16 363.16 15.877 0.0002289 *** ## Residuals 48 1097.92 22.87 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 The report \\(F\\) statistic is the same as the value reported earlier from summary(result). The first line of the output gives \\(SS_{R}\\), the second line gives \\(SS_{res}\\). The function doesn’t provide \\(SS_T\\), but we know that \\(SS_T = SS_{R} + SS_{res}\\). Again, to see what can be extracted from anova.tab: names(anova.tab) ## [1] &quot;Df&quot; &quot;Sum Sq&quot; &quot;Mean Sq&quot; &quot;F value&quot; &quot;Pr(&gt;F)&quot; So \\(SS_T\\) can be easily calculated: SST&lt;-sum(anova.tab$&quot;Sum Sq&quot;) SST ## [1] 1461.079 The \\(R^2\\) was reported to be 0.2485582. To verify using the ANOVA table: anova.tab$&quot;Sum Sq&quot;[1]/SST ## [1] 0.2485582 Correlation We use the cor() function to find the correlation between two quantitative variables: ##correlation cor(Data$family_income,Data$gift_aid) ## [1] -0.4985561 The correlation is -0.4985561. We have a moderate, negative linear association between family income and gift aid.

We will approximate standard error to 0.0272 where we mention \\(p = \\frac{a}{b}\\)↩︎ \\(p\\) is unknown but expected to be around 1/3.
